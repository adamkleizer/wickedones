# Cycle of Play

> “Keep your head down. The Wicked Ones are always watching and if you wanna stay here, you stay in their good graces. Work hard, toil away, and do what they command. But when they're not looking, it's us who're really in charge."

&mdash; Imp

## Cycle Overview

Gameplay focuses around a steady cycle of play that simulates life in a dungeon, progressing through four linear phases - lurking, calamity, raiding, and blowback. While these phases are set, there is also room to step outside of them and set up interesting scenes that come up during play without it needing to be related to that phase. The phases are there to help simulate dungeon life, but don't feel beholden to them if there's some scene you want to roleplay through!

- **Lurking**: You keep your head low, staying inside your dungeon while the heat dies down. You count up loot from a recent raid, lose yourself in revelry, and spend some downtime working on improving the dungeon by building traps, incanting rituals, torturing prisoners, and other nefarious activities typical of dungeon life.
- **Calamity**: Your time spent in the dungeon is not without risk. Tunnels might collapse, minions may kill each other, or you might draw the attention of an adventuring party resulting in a dungeon invasion. At the end of each lurking phase, the GM rolls calamity to see how smoothly things went while within the dungeon.
- **Raiding**: You head out of the dungeon to attack a target with the intention of furthering your master plan, gathering materials needed for loot, or pillaging to increase the size of your hoard. When raiding, you skip straight to the action by choosing a goal, a target, a plan, and some details. The GM then rolls engagement and tosses you into the action with the first step already in progress.
- **Blowback**: The surface is dangerous and your actions there are sure to bring the ire of its inhabitants. You might face an ambush, juicy hunting grounds may dry up, factions can move against you, and adventurers may be dispatched to end your existence. At the end of each raiding phase, the GM rolls blowback to see how smoothly things went while on the surface.

### Typical Sessions

Tabletop roleplaying game sessions can last anywhere from 2 to 8 hours. *Wicked Ones* functions pretty well with 3-4 hours of gametime, which usually gets you through three or four phases. Since calamity and blowback depend on how the roll goes, it's impossible to know how long they might take.

Don't feel like you have to cram all of the phases into a single session. While it's pretty satisfying to open up a session with lurking, do some downtime actions, deal with a small calamity, go on a raid, then wrap it up by defending your dungeon, that's a lot of stuff to pack into a session. The game usually runs better and everyone has more fun when you have some room to breathe. Take your time and set up cool scenes just for the fun of roleplaying through them.

## Lurking

From the relative safety of the dungeon, behind your traps and creatures, you bide your time and build up your defenses while looking for the next opportunity to strike. The lurking phase covers the everyday life within your dungeon. You go through **recovery** where you heal, count the loot you hauled in, enjoy some revelry, and work on **downtime projects** to improve the dungeon.

The **<ins>rule of description</ins>**, mentioned earlier in the book, is worth restating here. The lurking phase is a montage of things happening while you spend time within your dungeon. Time passes quickly and if things get interesting, zoom in on them and play out a scene. Remember that nothing happens in the game without description.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Recovery**: At the beginning of the lurking phase, you clear all stress, shock, and the bloodied condition. Any abilities, defenses, room, or gear that are usable once per cycle reset at this time. Your dungeon also automatically attracts a creature if you have an empty lair, filling lower tier lairs first.

### Counting Loot

[comment]: # (paragraph below mentions a page number in the original text, removed this)

As you return to your dungeon from raiding, you haul back any **<ins>loot</ins>** you gathered and heft it onto the hoard. Each player then makes a **loot roll** to find out what you do with it. This is a time to count your gold, find cool stuff in the loot, and enjoy some revelry which fills your dark heart with glee.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Loot rolls
> You roll dice equal to the amount of loot you hauled in from your last raid. Each die rolled gives you something based on its result.
>
> **Failure**: You enjoy your revelry. Gain a dark heart or give morale to your minion pack. If you have nowhere to spend this, you overdo it.  
**Mixed**: You gain 1 gold or spend it on revelry instead.  
**Success**: You pull a mundane or valuable item from the loot. The player chooses what it is.
>
> ❖ You can combine two successes into a critical to pull a powerful item from the loot instead. The GM chooses what it is.

When you engage in revelry, describe how you spend the loot on enjoying yourself and take a dark heart - or bring your minion pack into your revelry and they gain morale. Monsters don't have much impulse control, so it's pretty easy to get too caught up in the good times. If you have full dark hearts and your minions have morale already or you have no minions, you instead **overdo it**, causing an annoying or frustrating consequence within the dungeon related to your revelry.

#### Finding Items

When you get an item, you pull something useful from the loot that could have been found on the last raid. It has to make sense within that context.

- A *valuable item* is something a little rare and you’d be a bit surprised to find. It might be a few doses of a tier 1 potion or concoction or a tier 1 contraption or magic item. It could also be an item with an edge, a map with valuable information on it, or a rare musical instrument.
- A *powerful item* is a normal item with multiple edges or a tier 2 or 3 potion, concoction, contraption, or magic item. It could also be a one of a kind item that is highly sought after, a certain NPC’s prized possession, or a document with very secret information.

#### Revelry

You choose a type of revelry at character creation, your PC's favorite way to let off some steam. The available types of revelry are listed below, though you can also make up your own if none of these fit. Example consequences of overdoing it are listed after each. **The GM can also compel you to act on your revelry.**

- **Craving**: You have strong desires that must be quelled - food, flesh, luxuries.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You can't leave your lover's arms, losing your downtime action.
> - You develop an addiction, gaining a second dark impulse.
> - You dip into the hoard's gold, taking -1d on your next calamity roll.
- **Drinking**: You can't turn down a good brew.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You stumble and break a trap, reducing its tier by 1.
> - You take shock to BRAINS as you wake up with a hangover.
> - You have a falling out with a vile friend.
- **Gambling**: You love throwing the bones and making wagers.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You lose a piece of useful equipment in a game of chance.
> - You find yourself in debt to a dangerous entity.
> - Someone you cheated shows up during a raid to get revenge.
- **Occult**: You can't help involving yourself with strange, supernatural forces.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Your bizarre experiments result in your eyes changing color.
> - You're cursed, imposing -1d on your next dire roll.
> - A powerful magician becomes aware of your presence.
- **Violence**: You have a deep love for brawling, torture, and hurting others.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You go nuts on a creature or pack of minions, killing them.
> - You wreck one of the dungeon rooms making it unusable this cycle.
> - You meet your match and wind up with shock to ***MUSCLES***.
- **Worship**: You find comfort in worshipping your dark god.
[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You can't refuse your dark god's next compel.
> - An enemy of the faith sets out to find and destroy you.
> - Your god tires of your adoration, giving you shock to ***GUTS***.

[context]: # (example of play)
> The PCs head back to the dungeon, fresh off raiding a caravan from the abbey. They managed to hit a target at their tier, secure a piece of good loot, and kill an adventurer, so they make a 3d loot roll.
>
> *Prine rolls two dark hearts and a gold. However, he already has 1 dark heart, so he takes a second, then overdoes it.*
>
> **Prine**: "Okay, so my revelry is drinking. It looks like I'm gonna get wasted. I open up a cask of ale we looted and set out a bunch of mugs. It looks like I'm getting drinks for everyone, but after I finish pouring, I grab several in each hand and head back to my table alone."
>
> **GM**: "Let's say you destroy a tier 1 locked door. What's that look like?"
>
> **Prine**: "Obviously, I don't remember any of this, but you know that crystal door near the workshop? Yeah, later when I'm stumbling back towards my room, I take a running leap through that thing."
>
> *Skoggy rolls three gold. He already has two gold, so he instead spends 1 on his revelry.*
>
> **Skoggy**: "I'm just gonna spend that gold I don't have space for gambling with some minions. I lose a lot, but my minions are probably pretty stoked about it. They did a good job on the raid, so they deserve it."
>
> **GM**: "You know, they can go ahead and take morale there. They're in really great spirits anyway and winning some extra gold sits well."
>
> **Skoggy**: "Oh, seriously? That's awesome. Okay, cool."
>
> *Mace rolls two valuable items and a gold.*
>
> **Mace**: "You know, I think I'm gonna combine these 6s and take the powerful item. Maybe they were transporting some holy magic item?"
>
> **GM**: "Alright, let's say you find a red shawl adorned with the holy symbol of the Wayfinder, god of travel. Once per cycle, you can use it to create a sanctuary extending a short distance around yourself, preventing any evil creature from entering it."
>
> **Mace**: "Yeah, but I'm an evil creature, right?"
>
> **GM**: "That's the loophole, I suppose. It prevents things from entering after it's used. You can also use it once to teleport directly into the abbey, but it consumes the shawl. I guess the monks forgot about this."
>
> *Smarm rolls a valuable item, a gold, and a dark heart.*
>
> **Smarm**: "I'm going to have dinner, then head back to my room early. My revelry is occult, so let's say that the item I found was actually a holy book. Can I establish a fact about their religion with it?"
>
> **GM**: "That works really well, sure."
>
> **Smarm**: "Cool, I'll save that for a bit then. For my revelry, I just spend a long time pouring over this thing in the sanctum."

#### Downtime

After the revelry calms down, you have some time to spend building up your dungeon, preparing for your next raid, or working on something devilish of your own devising. These are called **downtime projects**. You can do things like build traps, craft potions, work on rituals, or break a prisoner’s spirit. You can take downtime actions to work on any of the downtime projects on the right. Downtime actions work as such:

- **Each PC takes one downtime action** during the lurking phase to show how they spent their time in the dungeon.
- **You can pay minions 1 gold** to undertake a downtime action on their own.
- You can gain additional downtime actions by taking certain calling abilities.
- You can also **<ins>flashback<ins>** to performing downtime actions that are immediately relevant to a scene, paying cost to represent the strenuous effort.

When you perform a downtime action, you make an action roll that represents your effort and then briefly narrate the results of the roll. **Downtime actions have <ins>dominant</ins> position**, unless there is an overwhelming circumstance towards position. You generally have enough time to safely work on a project.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Risk It**: Any downtime action that has a <ins>dominant</ins> position can be rerolled with normal position instead, recklessly pushing on to try to accomplish something and risking worse consequences. You must take the second result.

> - Brew
> - Build
> - Contact
> - Craft
> - Incant
> - Recruit
> - Torture

##### Project Tiers

Projects are rated from tier 1 to tier 3 according to how much effort they take to finish. This generally corresponds to the tier of what you're trying to make or is set by the GM according to the table below when it's unclear. Some projects are accomplishable with a single roll while others require you to fill a clock.

[context]: # (chances)
> ###### How Much Time is Required?
> | Tier 1 ❖ | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
> | :-: | :-: | :-:|
> | 1 Roll | 4-Segment Clock | 8-Segment Clock |
> | Accomplished relatively quickly by one PC. | Accomplished quickly by a group of PCs. | Takes a while, even for a group of PCs. |
>
> ❖ If you roll a mixed on a tier 1 project, you must also pay cost to complete it. If you roll a critical, you get something extra out of your effort!

##### Mixed Rolls on Tier 1 Projects

When you roll a mixed on a tier 1 project, it means that you had to give up something extra to accomplish what you’re working on. This could mean you’re wounded, lose some gold, anger a faction, or anything else that makes sense given the context of the downtime project. You pay cost, so the choice of what you’re willing to give up is yours to make. A mixed roll on a tier 2 or tier 3 project does not require you to pay cost, merely ticking the clock less than a success. If the action roll didn't have <ins>dominant</ins> position, you take a consequence chosen by the GM as normal.

##### Minion Downtime Actions

**You can pay your minions 1 gold to undertake a downtime action.** Minions are paid for by the hoard, but their job description only includes living in and defending the dungeon. To get them to do anything else, you’ll need to give them some incentive. They can work on any downtime project from the list. The *trained* upgrade gives them +1d on a specific type of downtime project.

##### Imp Downtime Actions

**Your imps take one downtime action of their own, rolling the dungeon tier.** The imps are always hard at work in the background and this action represents what they've been up to. The GM decides what this action is and makes the roll. Imps can work on projects PCs are working on, or something on their own.

This downtime action gives the GM some ability to introduce a bit more randomness into the dungeon or help out PCs who are having a rough time, failing a bunch of rolls. Imps might do things like dig tunnels between rooms that weren’t connected to make things easier for them to move around, start digging out a tier 3 room if the dungeon hasn't grown in a while, or work on something they overheard the Wicked Ones talking about (or their interpretation of what that meant). The GM can also lean into their traits when deciding what to work on.

##### Using Gold Instead of Downtime Actions

[comment]: # (paragraph below mentions a page number in the original text, removed this)

Gold can be used to accomplish many of the things you can do with downtime projects without putting forth any effort. Balancing how you use your gold and how you spend your downtime actions is essential for a quickly growing dungeon.

[context]: # (tips)
> ###### Game Pace and Turn Order
> During downtime, so many options sometimes leads to too much time spent pondering. To help with this, a turn order works nicely during downtime. The GM can choose the player that seems the most ready, then move around the table. Having your downtime actions ready beforehand also helps!

##### Downtime Projects

[comment]: # (the projects had page numbers below them, I'll add them as comment)

> **Brew a concoction or potion**, making two doses. This is always a tier 1 project, regardless of the tier of the concoction or potion. You take -1d on the roll if it's tier 2 and -2d if it's tier 3. On a mixed, it becomes volatile instead of requiring you to pay cost.
>
> *“I ***Invoke*** bloodcalling magic to make a Potion of Retching, mixing frog guts and snake eyes into the elixir.” On a mixed, you might decide that the potion sometimes seeps through its glass container.*

[comment]: # (link to: Factions)

> **Craft an item, edge, or contraption.** The project tier of a contraption equals its tier. A mundane item is a tier 1 project and adding an edge to an item is tier 2. Contraptions are always volatile.

> **Torture a prisoner** to either force them to reveal a single secret or break their spirit and make them do something for you. Getting information is always a tier 1 project and each prisoner knows a number of secrets equal to their tier. Getting them to do your bidding is a project equal to the prisoner's tier. Torturing is risky business, often killing a prisoner or pushing them to do something extreme. This is an overwhelming circumstance towards position.
>
> *“I want to Trick the templar into revealing her order's secrets.” On a mixed, the templar tells you some of what she knows, but jabs a piece of metal into her own throat while you're out of the room.*

[comment]: # (link to: Flow of Information)

You can track your project clocks on the character sheet. Just draw a 4 or 8-segment clock as needed. When it's finished, add it to your dungeon duties or wherever appropriate and erase it.

Players may want to do something during downtime that doesn't fit into one of the above downtime projects. In these cases, the GM decides if it's possible and sets the tier of the downtime project according to how long it might take.

## Calamity

Dungeons are messy conglomerations of minions pressed into service, creatures lairing in their confines, and a maze of tunnels throughout. They’re filled with traps and tricks in a haphazard fashion. Things are bound to go wrong eventually. After each lurking phase, the GM rolls to see if your dungeon managed to avoid any **calamity** during the phase. The number of dice rolled is determined by the amount of grumbling coming from the denizens of your dungeon.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> ### Calamity Rolls
> The GM rolls 1d, 2d, or 3d depending on how much the denizens of your dungeon are grumbling.
>
> **Failure**: You suffer a major calamity!  
**Mixed**: You suffer a minor calamity.  
**Success**: Your minions gain morale and join the next raid for free.  
**Critical**: Also, your imps dig into a "success" discovery!

[context]: # (chances)
> ### How Much Grumbling Is There in Your Dungeon?
> | 1d | 2d | 3d |
> | :-: | :-: | :-: |
> | Relentless whining and complaining | Normal levels of malcontent | Too happy or scared to complain. |

The key to minimizing grumbling in your dungeon is to follow **dungeon logic**. A dungeon that makes sense to minions makes them feel content. The more you think like a monster, the less calamity will befall your dungeon.

When you suffer a calamity, it often pulls you into a scene with the GM grabbing some dice and rolling engagement. This might be a fire raging inside your dungeon or a minion revolt. At other times, it might result in something that's over as soon as it happens, like a tunnel collapsing or minions getting killed by a trap. Calamity can also result in a dungeon invasion. The GM might instead choose to **<ins>pocket</ins>** the calamity and bring it into a later scene, such as your minions suddenly betraying you during a raid or one of your contraptions breaking when used.

**Calamity can't be resisted but you can start a scene to deal with any fallout from it.** Whatever happens just happens, but if you're resourceful, you can attempt to minimize collateral damage. A fire might start raging and destroy a room, threatening to spread to others but you can organize an effort to fight the fire to keep it from spreading. The initial calamity happens regardless, but the GM can threaten to let things spin out of control to push the PCs towards action to create challenging scenes within the dungeon.

### Dungeon Logic

Dungeons might not make a lot of sense to humans, but they make perfect sense to their denizens. This is called **dungeon logic** and basically reinforces how a fantasy dungeon operates like a fantasy dungeon. Normal levels of malcontent is the norm for your denizens, always finding something to complain about. There are 5 factors below which figure into dungeon logic. Generally, answering "no" to the questions pushes the roll towards 1d while answering yes pushes it towards 3d. The GM needs
to build a *gut feeling* for this dungeon logic. The below questions and guidelines can help:

- **Atmosphere**: Does the layout feel like a dungeon and do the minions enjoy living there?
- **Growth**: Has the dungeon been steadily growing, increasing in tier and adding rooms and discoveries?
- **Hierarchy**: Are weaker creatures likely to face adventurers before stronger
ones?
- **Loot and Revelry**: Has there been a steady flow of loot into the dungeon and has the dungeon survived your revelry intact?
- **Worthy Masters**: Have you formulated a solid master plan and garnered a
reputation of evil?

**Atmosphere** determines how content your denizens are on a day to day basis. They want your dungeon to make sense, feel like a dungeon, and have at least some rooms that they can enjoy. They desire a place that feels evil and dungeony. Make the dungeon look awesome and evil and your minions are going to be happy. Minor rooms have a positive effect on this, built mostly to make minions happy. Likewise, placing traps and locks in places that don’t make sense, like several in a row or one at each end of a hallway, frustrates or unnecessarily endangers them. If you have a hallway with 5 locked doors in it, it’s going to drive your denizens nuts.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Nowhere to get a drink, nowhere to have a good fight, and we just tossed out those perfectly good adventurer skulls! Those would have looked scary as hell on spikes!"

**Growth** is always on the minds of a dungeon's denizens. They yearn for power as much as their masters do because belonging to a strong dungeon means greater raids and more revelry. Adding to the hoard shuts minions up fast, as does building more rooms. When the dungeon stops growing, the denizens begin to worry. One cycle without growth might be fine, but longer periods of time without growth will have the denizens wondering what’s going on.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I saw that those orc scouts have been sleeping in the hallway. Getting pretty cramped here. The bosses downstairs seem to be busy with whatever they're cooking up, but don't seem to give a lick about us. And when was the last time we got to do any pillaging anyway?"

**Hierarchy** is of the utmost importance within a dungeon. There’s a reason the first few areas of a dungeon are filled with weaklings. Powerful monsters, such as upgraded minions, think it’s beneath them to face the enemy first. They want those weaker than them to soften up opponents. In the case of creatures, placing powerful creatures near your weaker monsters is likely to lead to the weaker ones getting munched on. It’s about fairness and pecking order. If you don’t respect this, you’re going to lose loyalty fast.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "This is bullshit. We get stuck guarding here, right by the entrance. You know who's gonna get a sword in their gut first? You and me, that's who. Probably won't even see it coming. Nah, some of those kobold miners should be here and us back there in the workshop."

**Loot and revelry** are an effective way of keeping your monsters in line. Making sure you go out of your way to increase loot rolls helps keep grumbling down. They join in on the good times and love it when their masters throw around gold freely. It's a double-edged sword, however, because when you overdo it with your revelry, it has a tendency to go poorly for your minions. And if you skip a raid or fail to bring back good loot, you're likely to hear some complaints.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Did you see what the Warlock did to Grubby? Poor guy had half his face melted off with acid. That's just not right, using us in their experiments like that. They brought us in to dig tunnels, not be part of weird experiments!"

**Worthy masters** demand loyalty from their minions, whether it be out of respect or fear. You have to present a strong front and any chinks in that armor quickly become apparent to those below you. Give them a reason to serve you by following through on your master plan and building a strong reputation as evil overlords among those on the surface. Engaging in activities that they see as below their masters, such as attacking weaker factions or backing down from a confrontation, will surely weaken their loyalty towards you.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "And then they just backed down, ran away like a bunch of... wait, sshhh. Okay, I thought they were coming. Anyway, like a bunch of cowards. Sure, me and the boys were ready to crack some guard skulls, but they just left us there as they saved their own hides while we got peppered with arrows. I'm just sayin', maybe it's time for new management."

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Calamity Ensures You Build a Fantasy Dungeon
> *Wicked Ones* is a game about dungeon building and dungeons might not always be completely logical to us humans. Basically, trying to “game the system” is likely to lead to calamity. The best practice here is to simply build a dungeon that feels like a dungeon.

### Types of Calamity

The severity of the calamity is determined by the calamity roll. The GM can come up with something fitting on their own, use the tables below to determine the category of the calamity, or roll on the detailed tables on the next page.

**Minor calamity** results in mishaps within your dungeon, small things that are a bother but don’t present an enormous challenge. They can generally be recovered from with a downtime action or two.

**Major calamity** results in big events that have a major impact on the dungeon. They're a serious setback that requires your immediate attention and puts a lot of pressure on the dungeon.

[randomizable]: # (random calamity)
#### Random Calamity
| | |
|--|--|
| 1 | Dungeon Invasion |
| 2 | Dungeon Invasion |
| 3 | Denizen Trouble |
| 4 | Denizen Trouble |
| 5 | Structural Problem |
| 6 | Outside Interference |

Below are just some of the categories of calamity that might befall your dungeon, though the GM is free to come up with their own that might not fit into these. Just keep in mind that **minor calamity should sting and major calamity should hurt**. The GM shouldn't pull their punches here. Make calamity an ever-present worry.

- **Dungeon Invasion**: Your activities within the dungeon bring the attention of adventurers, other dark factions, or local wildlife. Minor calamity invasions are always much weaker or unprepared for your dungeon and can serve as a good test of your defenses. When it's major calamity, they come in prepared to take you down.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - An adventurer and a few hirelings follow your minions home.
> - Adventurers spot smoke rising from your dungeon.
> - A massive bear wanders into your dungeon looking for a home.

- **Denizen Trouble**: The denizens in your dungeon start infighting, betray you, or make stupid mistakes. This could even lead to rebellion with major calamity.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A basilisk devours a pack of minions.
> - Imps steal or just lose a random item from a random PC.
> - Your minions head into the sanctum, weapons ready.

- **Structural Problem**: Your dungeon's rooms, walls, traps, and so on fail or fall apart in some way.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A cave-in fills a tunnel with rubble, making it impassable.
> - You lose all progress on a tier 3 room clock as it collapses.
> - A lava flow bursts through a wall, destroying a tier 3 trap.

- **Outside Interference**: Forces from outside of your dungeon move against you. This could be another faction discovered underground, something burrowing into your dungeon, or heavy rains flooding your halls.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A dire mole burrows into the dungeon, making a second entrance.
> - A hostile underground faction appears near the dungeon.
> - Rain floods your halls, drowning some creatures and minions.

## Raiding

No dungeon is self-sufficient - you need resources from outside, whether that be warm bodies standing between you and adventurers, riches to fuel your hoard, or materials to build more rooms. You leave your dungeon to further your nefarious master plan, deal with factions, and loot the riches of the overworld. Raiding consists of figuring out your goal, choosing a target, setting a plan, then launching the raid itself. After a small amount of planning, **raids let you skip directly to the action in progress**.

You work together to terrorize civilized lands, looting your way along as you work towards your objective. You might burn down a farmer’s house, kidnap a priest for sacrifice, steal a wizard’s magic staff, or hold tense negotiations with hostile tribes. Regardless of the objective, you always make time to fill your pockets with gold along the way.

### Launching a Raid

Dungeon monsters are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to knowledge of the world around them. The overworld is too dangerous to scout so you’re going to be striking out blind for the most part. **Scouting targets is only done through a few specific methods**: calling abilities, dungeon rooms, torturing prisoners, and flashbacks.

However, even if the PCs don’t know much about the world, the players do and
they can use that information to judge what would be a worthwhile or fun raid. As covered in **<ins>Flow of Information</ins>**, it’s expected for the players to act on knowledge that their PCs might not have and for the GM to freely share all but the most secretive of information. This free flow of information will come in handy as you set up your raid plan.

Raids let you skip directly into a high stakes, high reward scene. Sometimes that scene covers the main part of the raid, hitting the target itself. Other times, the challenge and fun might be in getting there or getting way. You cut away all the boring stuff and jump directly to the mayhem.

To help set up the scene, you have to give the GM the following key pieces of info:
- You need a **goal**. What are you trying to accomplish?
- You need a **target**. Who are you hitting?
- You need a **plan**. How do you want to go about doing it?
- You need some **details**. How does this thing get started?
Once the GM has all the info, they roll engagement and the action starts.

[context]: # (important rule)
> "Raid" is a catch-all term for any group foray onto the surface. It covers attacks and looting, but also things like negotiations or sneaking through secure areas.

#### The Goal & The Target

Your first step is figuring out why you’re raiding the surface. What’s your goal? What do you want to accomplish? Here are some common reasons to raid:

- Acquire the materials for a tier 3 room.
- Aid a faction that has asked you for help and receive something in return.
- Further the steps of your master plan.
- Get revenge against those who slighted you because they deserve it.
- Meet the special requirements for a ritual to finish it off.
- Pillage a higher tier faction to fill your hoard and increase the dungeon tier.
- Press other monsters into service as minions.
- Pressure a faction into taking action so you don’t have to.
- Stop a troublesome clock to avoid its fallout.
- Subjugate a faction to expand your influence in the area.
- Wrangle powerful creatures to let them loose against your foes.

**You loot automatically with every raid, so focus on accomplishing other things.** Once you know why you’re raiding, you can start searching the sandbox map for targets. When you set up the sandbox, you fill it with factions you want to interact with and each of these factions is likely to have juicy targets. However, if loot is the only thing you want, then go on a pillaging raid to increase your dungeon tier!

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Frum**: "We need materials for our workshop. I guess some tools and supplies like nails and metal scraps for it makes the most sense."
>
> **Zil**: "What if we tried hitting a supply caravan along this road moving towards the saw mill there? They probably need a lot of tools for their work and the foresters are the same tier as our dungeon."

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Cerus**: "Okay, where can we get the scroll of rites to finish off the special requirements for the ritual?."
>
> **Tix**: "Maybe hit the wizard tower? It's pretty likely they have a library."
>
> **Portoc**: "Um, they're two tiers above us. That's suicide, no way. Maybe this small town here has a temple in it that we can raid?"
>
> **GM**: "Sure, their archives will have the rites you need."
>
> **Cerus**: "Okay, cool... let's go with that, then. Plus it'll be more fun defiling a temple and angering one of their gods."


##### Faction Tiers and Targets

Factions are much larger than your dungeon and the two aren’t directly comparable. You don’t target factions, you find targets to hit within those factions that fall under their protection. How much there is to gain but also how tough a target is to raid is determined by how the faction tier or your target compares to your dungeon's.

**Higher tier than your dungeon** means they have many circumstances towards position and effect working in their favor, such as larger scale, better equipment, greater skill, stronger magic, or specific defenses that are difficult to overcome.

**Same tier as your dungeon** means they only have circumstances working for them that are strong points of the faction they belong to or the specific nature of the target. It mostly feels like you’re on even footing when contending with them.

**Lower tier than your dungeon** means they usually don’t have much working in their favor. You're likely to overwhelm them, even having circumstances favoring you that you normally wouldn’t. Hitting lower tier targets can anger your minions.

- **Tier 0 targets** are isolated, without much chance of help coming and mostly
lacking in defenses.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A hedge mage and their sprite buddies.
> - A farmhouse with a few able-bodied farmers.
> - A traveling merchant with a few workers.

- **Tier 1 targets** can defend themselves and see trouble coming.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A farming community's granary.
> - A small band of bandits fresh off their own raid.
> - An apothecary in a small hamlet.

- **Tier 2 targets** are in established locations, with safety in numbers or better training. They know what they protect is valuable.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A dwarven mining camp.
> - A shipment to a border watchtower.
> - A merchant caravan with mercenary guards heading towards a village.

- **Tier 3 targets** are expecting trouble. They're located in areas with permanent defenses or have regular, well-trained guards. They respond quickly to attacks.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The library at a warrior monk abbey.
> - A dryad, deep in an ancient forest.
> - A patrol from a border garrison.

- **Tier 4 targets** are incredibly tough. They're located in large settlements or have groups of trained warriors at their disposal.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A lord's manor in a walled town.
> - A well-armed merchant ship.
> - A wizard tower full of golems.

##### Setting the Raid Scene

After you know your target and your goal, announce them to the GM. Each raid has three parts: **the approach**, **the goal**, and **the getaway**. On a normal raid, you only zoom in to one of these scenes, with the players or GM briefly narrating the others. Which scene you focus on generally is determined by the nature of the target itself. There are two scenarios:

**Scenario 1: The target itself is well-defended or the goal is challenging to accomplish.** Most raids are of this type. In this case, the raid scene is focused on the goal. The engagement roll puts us at the first stages of the plan being put into action with the goal accomplishable within the scene. The approach and the getaway are blended into the background and assumed to be accomplishable easily enough.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You want to hit a few of the outer farms of the nearby town. The action might start with you jumping over a fence, only to realize the farm has dogs sleeping in the field you’re in. If things don’t go well, hardy farmers will rush out to repel you and protect their families.
> - You want to ambush and scare off some merchants and their mercenaries on the road. The action might start off with you about to start whooping and hollering. If things don’t go well, you will have fight them all.
> - You want to creep into the secluded temple to secure a chalice needed for your ritual. The action might start with you hiding under a cart heading into the walled compound. If things don’t go well, the clerics in their dormitory are sure to wake up and come investigate.

**Scenario 2: The target itself is undefended or the goal is easy to accomplish, but the region as a whole is well defended.** The raid scene is focused on getting to the target or the return back to the dungeon with the goal in the background.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You finish up accosting travelers on the road, demanding payment. However, a patrol has caught wind of you and you zoom in to the action starting with you hearing riders thundering down the road.
> - You sneak between border guard posts and then zoom out as you finally reach and easily burn down the minor noble’s estate. The ensuing chaos covers your getaway.
> - You kidnap the princess as she stupidly rides through the royal forest with only one of her servants. You zoom in as the action begins hours later with a search party’s hounds cornering you in a gully.

As players discuss possible targets, it’s up to the GM to inform them of what type of scene the raid will focus on. While the GM decides which scenario makes the most sense, you should try to contribute ideas about what sounds fun to play through.

#### The Plan & The Details

Once the target has been set, the GM tells you what type of scene the raid will likely focus on and some details about what it might look like, like some riders running you down on the road or you starting on the outskirts of town.

Once you have this information, you need to work together to come up with a plan. Plans are basic outlines of how you’re going to deal with the scene you zoom into in the raid. Following through with your plan reduces the likelihood of **<ins>blowback</ins>**, while the plan going off the rails increases it. What it means to stick to the plan is expanded upon further in the **<ins>blowback section</ins>** later in this chapter.

You choose from one of the plans below, then answer two or three questions posed by the GM. Each plan has some example questions with it, but the GM knows the details they need the most and can ask anything. The players can also add in information they want to see in the scene. Once the GM has this info, they’ve got enough to roll engagement and paint the scene, tossing you into the action.

##### Ambush

Hit them when they least expect it, making sure they don't take
any of you down in the process.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Why is their guard down?
> - Where are you waiting?
> - What’s the signal?

##### Assault

Bring full force to bear, driving off or killing all those who stand against you.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Where does the assault begin?
> - Who leads the way?
> - Do you avoid specific targets?

##### Negotiation
Talk it out, tell lies, or offer something to get what you want, spilling as little blood as possible.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Where’s the meeting spot?
> - What are you offering?
> - Are you there in good faith?

##### Stealth
Slip in, find what you're after, and slip out quietly, being noticed as little as possible.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Where do you slip in?
> - What time of day is it?
> - Do you split up or stick together?

##### Strike
Bust in, get what you want, and run out quickly, without deviating from your goal.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - How do you get in?
> - Who signals to get out?
> - What guards your prize?

##### Trickery
Confuse, lure, or trick them into doing what you want, without letting on until it's too late.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - What do you want them to do?
> - Why would they do that?
> - Does it matter if they know after?

#### Best Practices

Raiding is a way to cut to the good stuff. It provides a framework for players and the GM to do some rapid worldbuilding on the fly, come up with a few interesting details, help paint the scene, and then skip right to the action. It lets you spend more time roleplaying your characters and less time in player to player discussion.

1. **Embrace raiding and skip the boring stuff.** Endless “what ifs” are easy to get caught up in, but what you’re at the table to do is tear up some civilized lands. Hone in on a goal, a target, and a plan quickly. Come to the table with ideas in mind. A bit of discussion can be fun, but try not to let it devolve into deadlock.

2. **The GM’s job is to nudge players towards quick decisions.** Ask pointed questions like “What does your dungeon need?” or “Where do you think you can find that?” When discussion turns towards deadlock, choose two options and push the PCs into a power struggle to reach a quick decision.

3. **Worldbuild as a group, on the fly, when it’s most important to the story.** The finer details of the sandbox aren’t clear until you have a chance to interact with them. Raid planning is just another chance to add more detail to the world, doing it right when it matters most - just before jumping into a scene.

4. **The GM’s job is to encourage players to establish facts about the world.** Players are co-authors of the game and while the GM has the final say, when asked questions about the plan, players can just ask the GM if certain details can be true. Their PCs can act on this information, even if they don’t know it.

5. **Pick the raid that sounds the funnest, not the easiest or even the smartest.** Any raid you come out the other side of is going to do something for your dungeon. When a cool idea gets thrown out there, don’t talk yourself out of going after it just because it seems tough or problematic.

6. **The GM’s job is to create challenging raids and represent the factions.** Think about the faction’s strong points and represent those within the raid, putting obstacles in the PCs’ path. It’s tough being a monster and there’s always something in their way. Make sure to make that something fun to kill.

### Loot

While out on a raid, monsters are always on the lookout for loot. Looting is the unstated primary purpose of every raid, meaning no matter what the goal you’ve set for the raid, you’re assumed to also be looting in the background which guarantees you at least something each time. You can then go out of your way to secure more.

Throughout a raid, you build a pool of dice that represents the loot you gather and roll it later back at your dungeon and pull gold or items out of the loot, or maybe spend it on enjoying yourself and earning some dark hearts.

Loot is tracked by the GM throughout a raid. You start at 0d and add dice as follows:
- Take +1d for a target belonging to a faction at least equal to the dungeon tier.
- Take +1d for each tier the target faction is above the dungeon tier.
- Take +1d for each source of good loot you grab.
- Take +1d for each adventurer you take out.

**Good loot** requires going out of your way to acquire it. You’ve already snagged the easy to grab loot just lying around - that’s all wrapped up in the base roll. Any extra sources of loot are going to be guarded, hidden, or just plain difficult to haul away. Keep in mind that just because you’re looking for something extra doesn’t mean it’s there - sometimes there’s just nothing else around worth taking. Higher tier targets are more likely to have sources of good loot.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You ransack a peasant’s house, stealing their treasured belongings.
> - You stuff a huge bag full of chickens and sling it over your back.
> - You hitch your minions up to a grain cart and have them pull it away.

**Taking out an adventurer** might mean killing them, but it could also mean capturing them or making them run away. It’s assumed that you have time to loot their body or snag something they dropped. However, outrunning or sneaking away from an adventurer isn’t taking them down. This is why monsters are drawn towards adventurers like flies to honey - they know the adventurer is carrying something good.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Keep Basic Loot Abstract and Good Loot Concrete
> Of course monsters loot. If there's one thing that every adventurer knows, it's that if you kill a monster, they'll drop some gold. It's just in a monster's nature to be picking up stuff as they raid the overworld. This doesn't make for all that compelling gameplay, though. So what we do is just assume that monsters are looting by default instead of scrambling to grab anything not nailed down. By blending this more mundane looting into the background, it makes space for more interesting scenes where you have to really go out of your way to grab something good and worthwhile. That's some good loot.

### Wrapping Up

Each raid lasts as long as it takes, whether it's the approach, the goal, or the getaway, though it's usually quite clear when the action dies down. At other times, it might not be so clear. The easy answer here is that a raid is finished in different fashions, depending on the scenario. If you're making an approach, you zoom out when the path between you and the goal is clear. If the scene focuses on the goal, accomplishing the goal and eliminating immediate threats lets you zoom out. And if it's the getaway, you can probably zoom out when your path home is clear.

Sometimes, raid scenes end incredibly quickly. A great engagement roll followed by a few successes or maybe a critical on well-chosen actions can wrap things up very fast. **GMs, don't cheat your players out of these easy wins!** Raids have a strong tendency to spin out of control with complications arising from failures and dark impulses pulling PCs away from their goals. That’s just the nature of raids. So when everything just lines up perfectly, the PCs should be able to savor in an easy victory.

#### Aftermath of Raids

Apart from the benefits to your dungeon and the blowback you might suffer, raids have whatever other effects on the fiction that seem logical. **Blowback isn't the only way for factions to move in response to raids.** Often traveled roads may close down or outposts abandoned, making your raid targets shrink up. Other factions in the region might fortify as news travels, especially from nearby neighbors. The aftermath might be immediate or it might start or tick **<ins>faction clocks</ins>**.

The GM should mark down where each raid happens and what session it happens in on the faction sheet to give an idea of the shockwaves that raids can send and help track them throughout the campaign. This makes it easier to see how different factions should respond.

> ##### The Power of Grabbing Some Dice
> As talk at the table turns toward the next raid, the GM should pick up some dice and say something like, “Okay, where are you gonna raid?” Show the dice and say, “Let’s get a goal, a target, and a plan out there so I can roll engagement and cut to some action.” It’s the GM’s job to push this. You set the pace. Drag details out of your players. Shake those dice and let them know time’s wasting. And as soon as you have enough info, declare the engagement roll and throw the dice. Then step back, take a breather, and think things through before you paint the scene.

[context]: # (example of play)
> The PCs want some mining equipment to build a room in the dungeon, so they decide on an ambush against some dwarves as they head back into their mines from a recent trip to the surface.
>
> **GM**: "Okay, where are you all going to be hiding?"
>
> **Lammo**: "I think we cover ourselves in soot and hide along the walls."
>
> **GM**: "Pretty creative, okay. Why do you think their guard is down?"
> **Max**: "They're just heading back into the mines after a midwinter festival, bellies fat and enjoying life."
>
> **GM**: "Cool, so what's the signal? When does all of this start off?"
>
> **Max**: "We wait until they pass by completely and hit them from behind. If one of us is spotted, that one acts like they're alone to throw them off."
>
> **GM**: "Okay, great. That's enough to roll engagement. I'm thinking this is 1d, because, well, the dwarves are expert miners and more likely to notice something strange against the walls."
>
> On a failure, the action might start off with one of the PCs being spotted and grabbed by a dwarf.
> 
> On a mixed, the action might start off with one of the dwarves asking, "Did you just hear something?"
>
> On a success, the action might start off with the dwarves moving past you, failing to notice you clinging to the walls. They're easy pickings, completely unaware of your presence.
>
> On a critical, the dwarves come in arguing and jostling each other, which then breaks out into a fight as one dwarf insults another's beard.

> **Chort**: "Let's do a negotiation with the moon elves. We took a couple of them prisoner last time we raided them, so maybe they want them back. We can see what they'll give up. Maybe we can convince them to help us deal with the griffon riders?"
>
> **GM**: "Where's the meeting spot?"
>
> **Chort**: "I mean, we're actually coming to trade. No ill intentions. We can go to them, I guess. Let's try to get spotted near the forest edge."
>
> **Merv**: "Let's take one prisoner, but leave the others behind."
>
> **Chort**: "Yeah. I'll keep ahold of them with a dagger to their throat."
>
> **GM**: "I think I have enough to go on. Let's call this a 2d roll on engagement, mostly because they're surprised at the sheer audacity of it."

### Pillaging

Pillaging is a massive endeavor which grows your hoard by bringing large amounts of gold and resources back into your dungeon. When pillaging, loot is the goal and you have to hit a significant target with a multi-part plan. If you manage to pull it off, **it increases your dungeon tier and the faction you hit loses a tier.**

[context]: # (important rule)
> When you pillage, you must hit a target belonging to a faction a tier higher than your dungeon. Aiming high like this and bringing back a huge portion of their wealth is the only way to grow the hoard enough to increase your dungeon tier.

Pillaging a target requires two raids. First, you must go on an initial **setup raid** that creates an advantage or opening that you can leverage to follow through with the **pillaging raid** against a faction’s center of power or a major source of wealth. Normally, such an attack would be outside of possibility for a raid as factions are quite larger than a dungeon in scope, but the setup raid creates an opportunity.

Once you decide to go pillaging, you need to search for a faction to hit and get an idea in mind for what your pillaging raid might be. Figure out what faction makes the most sense to attack, what your target will be, and what you’ll be looting from them. You don’t have to settle on a plan for it at this time.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You decide to rampage through the nearby town, whose outer walls and guard patrols currently make it impossible.
> - You want to loot the archmage’s tower and steal his ancient tomes, though his golems and magic have kept you from it so far.
> - You plan to head deep into the dwarven tunnels, hauling away their gold. The sheer amount of dwarves has deterred you until now.

#### Setup Raid

After you decide your primary target, you search for a smaller target and set a goal that can help create an advantage on the pillaging raid. This target can be from your primary target’s faction or even from another faction if it makes sense. Once you have an idea in mind, choose a plan and launch the raid. If you manage to accomplish your goal, make a loot roll with the spoils from the setup raid to celebrate the victory.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You start a full-scale attack on a hamlet, but quickly pull away as you trick the faction's defenses into moving towards that point.
> - You sneak into an outpost and loot their maps, finding a route through the forest and past their defenses.
> - You negotiate with a goblin chieftess, asking her to send your warriors with you, but you end up having to bust heads until they agree.

#### Pillaging Raid

Immediately after the setup raid and the following loot roll, you dive right into the pillaging raid. There is no time for recovery or returning to the dungeon in between. You have to strike while the iron is hot, else lose the advantage you’ve created. It’s time to choose a plan for your pillaging raid. You can lean into the events of the setup and the current status of your group to choose the plan that works best.

Finishing this raid should require either gathering a substantial amount of good loot or securing one very valuable item. Getting this amount of loot out of the immediate area should be a challenge. Whereas loot tends to be background in normal raids, it’s the primary objective in this one - and getting “enough” should prove quite challenging. **You must deal a major blow to the faction, dropping them a tier.**

[context]: # (example of play)
> Setup Raid: **Stealth** ➡ Pillaging Raid: **Strike**
>
> The riches of the river town have always been out of reach. You know that its wealthy merchant mayor must have a lot of wealth on his estate in the middle of town, so you decide to ransack it. Unfortunately, high walls stand in your way so you lay out a plan. First, you decide to **stealth** into a fishing village upriver, steal some ships, and float downwards towards the river town’s port.
>
> From there, you launch a **strike** heading to the estate as fast as possible, ransacking it, and slipping over the walls before the guards have time to respond.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Setup Raid: **Ambush** ➡ Pillaging Raid: **Trickery**
>
> The baron has maintained a strong presence in the region with their garrison for quite some time, always looming over you. A decisive attack, seizing their stock of arms and armor will be enough to set them back and help equip your raiders. The troops themselves are fierce though, so you can't attack them head on. Instead, you set an **ambush** on a grain caravan heading towards the fort. Once they're subdued, your Warlock enchants them, forcing them to bring the caravans into the garrison as you hide inside the carts.
>
> You arrive at sunset and the enchanted crew tell the guards they'll empty the wagons in the morning. Late that night, you set out and begin your **trickery**. A few PCs and minion packs load weapons and armor from the armory into the carts as fast as they can, while another PC goes to open the garrison gates and run interference with the guards. The last PC heads into the stable, killing any horses they don't need. Once the carts are full, you lash some terrified horses to them and barrel recklessly out of the garrison gates.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Setup Raid: **Negotiation** ➡ Pillaging Raid: **Assault**
>
> The elves have controlled the southern forest for too long, its treelines protected by woodland creatures. Recently, a group of elven adventurers invaded your halls so you feel like it's time for some revenge. First, you set up a **negotiation** with the goblin tribe. You have kept your distance from them until now, being the unstable Labisha-worshipping cannibals that they are. But there's bloody work ahead and you're sure they'll want in on it.
>
> Once you've secured their help, you launch a full-on **assault** into the elven woodlands. The goblins move in from the west while you and your dungeon's minions come at them from the north. As you move through the woods, you set fires sending smoke throughout the trees to create confusion. You dispatch the outer sentries and butcher your way to the home tree. The goblin chief and his warriors meet you there, blood fresh on their lips. The elves flee as you torch the great, ancient tree while your minions start gathering anything of value they can find.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Setup Raid: **Trickery** ➡ Pillaging Raid: **Negotiation**
>
> You know the arcane college houses riches such as artifacts and ancient scrolls, but the threat of their powerful magic is a strong deterrent. You start off with some **trickery**, using firebombs to light the building next door on fire. In the ensuing panic, you slip into the back door of the arcane college, spread out in the common room, and wait.
>
> As the wizards come back inside, they're greeted by the sight of you standing confidently, waiting for them. They pull out magic tomes and wands intent on dispatching you, but then notice the puny kobold minions with tier 3 bombs strapped to their back. Now the **negotiation** begins. By the end of it, you have them heaping piles of treasure onto a cart and head out of town with a master wizard in tow just in case.

[context]: # (tips)
> ##### Pillaging is Hard
> Pillaging is meant to be a major hurdle and strategic challenge for players. Most raids are about just choosing the funnest or most monstery thing you can do, but pillaging is all about getting strategic and trying to survive two raids in a row against a higher tier target. So when pillaging, be sure to bring all of your resources to bear. Grab your minions, make up some concoctions and potions, enlist vile friends for help, and buy off factions to assist you because you’re going to need their help.

## Blowback

Raiding the overworld is bound to draw some attention. Before your dungeon appeared, the region was in relative balance but the added pressure from your attacks starts to throw things into chaos. Your incursions will catch up to you sooner or later and you're going to suffer some blowback. However, the closer you can stick to the raid plans you set out, the more you can minimize this likelihood.

You're definitely not welcome on the surface and while a few monster tribes may be friendly with your dungeon, the vast majority of surface dwellers would love nothing more than to see you dead. After the roaming phase ends, usually just after a raid wraps up, you make a blowback roll determining how the world immediately responds to your actions during this phase. Depending on the roll, you might suffer **minor blowback** or **major blowback**.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> ### Blowback Rolls
> The GM rolls 1d, 2d, or 3d depending on how well you stuck to the raid plan.
>
> **Failure**: You suffer major blowback!  
**Mixed**: You suffer minor blowback.  
**Success**: Each PC gains a dark heart.  
**Critical**: Also, you can choose a faction to take the blame instead of you.

[context]: # (chances)
> ### How well did you stick to the plan?
> | 1d | 2d | 3d |
> | :-: | :-: | :-: |
> | Went off the rails. | Went a little awry. | Went perfectly. |

Each raid plan has a guideline that you have to follow if you want to minimize blowback. Some amount of failure is built into the plan, giving a little leeway in following it. A failure or two, a dark impulse compelled, or a dark bargain aren't usually enough to derail it. But more than just a few or completely abandoning the plan will leave you vulnerable to blowback that you won't see coming.

The exact nature of blowback and where it comes from is up to the GM. It can immediately follow the roll or can be pocketed by the GM and brought out later at a more impactful or convenient time. The blowback often flows directly from recent events, but it can also completely blindside the PCs as their interference in the overworld has pushed factions into moving in ways they're not aware of.

Blowback often results in zooming into a scene in progress like being ambushed as you return to your dungeon. At other times, it might result in something immediate that doesn't require a scene, like each PC losing a gold. **Blowback can't be resisted.**

### Following the Plan

During an **ambush**, you make sure nobody falls. An ambush is about catching your enemy off guard and minimizing your own losses.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - 3d: You sprung the ambush on the riders perfectly. They fell into the trench you dug, then you dropped rocks on them from the trees.
> - 2d: One of the riders managed to jump the trench and stuck an arrow in the Brute's chest. Your goblin minions also fell out of their tree and died.
> - 1d: Even though the trench worked, the riders clawed their way out of it. In the ensuing melee, they cut down the Shadow before dying.

During an **assault**, you drive off or kill all those who stand against you. An assault is about proving you're mightier and crushing any challenge.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - 3d: You climbed over the side of the boat, cutting down the sailors as they scrambled to form a defense. They were quickly broken.
> - 2d: The sailors put up a good fight, the captain was tougher to put down than expected, and several jumped overboard and swam to safety.
> - 1d: The fight on the deck was brutally fought and hard won, but the sailors fell back to a hold below deck and you left before finishing the job.

During a **negotiation**, you spill as little blood as possible. A negotiation is about avoiding conflict with charm or relying on threats instead of direct violence.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - 3d: You coaxed the dryad into coming out and talking. While negotiations were tense, she agreed to swap a bag of seeds for the prince's golden hair.
> - 2d: The dryad seemed willing to talk, but you realized it was a trap when you heard a bear growling behind you. After you brought it down, you threatened the dryad's life and she gave up the bag of seeds.
> - 1d: The dryad wouldn't speak to you and your threats angered her. She called the creatures of the woodlands into a bloody fight with you, with both the dryad and the Marauder getting killed.

During **stealth**, you avoid being noticed. Stealth is about not letting anyone know you're there and getting out without being spotted.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - 3d: You scaled halfway up the wizard's tower, snuck past the magical wards, unlocked the door silently, grabbed the tome without alerting the golems, glided off the roof into the harbor, and swam away unnoticed.
> - 2d: You almost made it through all of that, but dropped the tome, waking up the golem. Your quick reaction kept the noise to a minimum, though.
> - 1d: The wizard's pet pseudodragon spotted you climbing up the side of the tower just as you ducked into the window. This led to you being careless and setting off the magical wards and the pseudodragon waking the golem before you got there.

During a **strike**, you stick to the path you've set. A strike is about prioritizing your objective and getting out as quickly as possible.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - 3d: You rushed deep into the forest, too fast for the elven rangers to catch you. You evaded their traps, made your way to their town in the trees, and kidnapped several elves you need for your ritual.
> - 2d: Although you made it past the outer sentries, the Shadow got pulled up into a tree by a trap and had to be cut down. This gave the elves time to try fleeing, so it took you longer than expected to gather the prisoners.
> - 1d: The Brute took an arrow to the thigh, so you had to fight your way through the sentries. The running townsfolk made it difficult to gather prisoners and the cruel Shaman ended up getting killed while tormenting the fleeing elves.

During **trickery**, you don't let on to your intentions until it's too late. Trickery is about making sure you get the target to do what you want and taking advantage of it.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> -3d: The farmers rushed to the hayfield to put out the fire raging there as you slipped into the barn and made off with some livestock.
> - 2d: A fire in these cold months didn't make sense, making the farmers suspicious. They left a few people to watch the livestock
> - 1d: The fire fails to spread quickly, instead serving as a warning sign. The farmers hole up inside the barn, but break and flee when you light
it on fire.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: Alright, you guys manage to slip back into the treeline, bags of grain slung over your back. That was a really messy ambush, though, with everyone ending up with shock or bloodied. That's 1d blowback.
>
> *The GM rolls 1d for blowback and gets a failure.*
>
> **GM**: "Okay, you're working your way through the woods, heading back
to the dungeon. Grell, what's your ***Scan***?"
>
> **Grell**: "Umm... 2d. Why?"
>
> *The GM rolls 2d for engagement and gets a failure.*
>
> **GM**: "That's not good. You step on the trap and a rope tightens around your leg, then hauls you up into the tree. You're hanging upside down from a tree limb. From the bushes in front of you, several arrows fly your way. Merlok, you're now bloodied, too."
>
> **Merlok**: "Woah, what the hell's going on? We can't resist, right?"
>
> **GM**: "You all remember those rangers you stole from a couple of sessions ago? This is their payback. Now you're getting ambushed. The blowback is the ambush, which can't be resisted, but the trap and these arrows definitely can be."

### Types of Blowback

The severity of the blowback is determined by the blowback roll. The GM can then use the table below to determine the category of the blowback, roll on the detailed tables on the next page, or come up with something of their own.

**Minor blowback** results in an inconvenience, but one that you’re likely equipped to ignore or handle. It usually tinges the last raid with bitterness, though still overall worthwhile.

**Major blowback** results in an immediately pressing concern that must be dealt with, risking the success of your latest raid or even your lives. It might also substantially change the sandbox map.


[randomizable]: # (random blowback)
> #### Random Blowback
> | | |
> |--|--|
> | 1 | Dungeon Invasion |
> | 2 | Dungeon Invasion |
> | 3 | Dungeon Invasion |
> | 4 | Travel Trouble |
> | 5 | Factions / Sandbox |
> | 6 | Ambush / Capture |

Below are just some of the categories of blowback that might befall your dungeon, though the GM is free to come up with their own that might not fit into these. Just keep in mind that **minor blowback should sting and major blowback should hurt.** The GM shouldn't pull their punches here. Make blowback an ever-present worry.

- Dungeon Invasion: A group of adventurers, soldiers from a local faction, a powerful beast, or some other entity enters your dungeon and makes its way towards your sanctum. Minor blowback invasions are always much weaker or unprepared for your dungeon and can serve as a good test of your defenses. When it's major blowback, they come in prepared to take you down.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A group of hunters wander into the dungeon.
> - An adventuring party is hired to bring you down.
> - A massive wyvern chases you home and into your caves.

- Factions / Sandbox: Your raid spurs a faction, either the one you hit or another affected by it in some way, into action. They might finish off a clock, start a new one, or act immediately in their best interests.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The two tribes decide to end their conflict and protect their lands.
> - The town stops sending trading caravans along that route.
> - Reinforcements from afar boost the garrison's tier by 1.

- Travel Trouble: The need to stay off well traveled paths makes moving across the overworld quite treacherous.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A heavy fog separates you in a forest, then you hear wolves growling.
> - You get stuck in a storm with heavy waves crashing into your ship.
> - You drop some equipment scaling a cliff.

- Ambush / Capture: Someone you have wronged in the past goes out of their way to take you down. They either set up an ambush to take advantage of a vulnerable position you're in or capture a Wicked One or dungeon denizen.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The Brute is captured by a local patrol after you get split up.
> - Everyone falls into a pit trap and you hear the sound of snakes.
> - A volley of arrows suddenly pepper you and force you into cover.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "Alright, I think you've been hitting this part of the region a bit too much. They've figured out that they're easy targets, so they sent word off to the far away duke. I'm starting a 4-segment clock here, at the end of which a new tier 3 faction will arrive: Knights of the Flame. When they're in play, they'll be patrolling the roads in the area, kind of a moving faction with short clocks aimed at protecting that area."
>
> **Melly**: "Can I resist that?"
>
> **GM**: "Blowback can't be resisted - but the blowback is just the clock starting. You can try to keep it from ticking, though the message has already been sent so this is more of a timer. Maybe there's a raid you could go on or a ritual that you can incant?"

#### Pocketing Blowback and Calamity

Sometimes blowback or calamity is rolled, but the timing just isn't right for it. Maybe the session is about to draw to a close or you want to keep the focus on other events. Whatever the reason, the GM can always just pocket blowback or calamity, marking it on the GM sheet, and bringing it into play later. This is a valuable wild card that the GM can throw into the middle of later phases to spice them up. This keeps the flow of the story flexible as while the cycle of play is rigid and linear, the fallout from your actions can blend into the story in the way that makes the most sense.

[context]: # (example of play)
> You finish up a tough raid, a mostly pyrrhic victory, when the unbelievably cruel GM decides to use pocketed blowback. The goblin tribe you tricked earlier ambushes you with poisoned darts. You wake up hanging from poles upside down on your way to see their chief.

[context]: # (example of play)
> You roll a failure making a Mooncurse Potion and the GM decides to use pocketed calamity, immediately affecting you with the Mooncurse. The next full moon, you're a hungry werewolf on the prowl in the dungeon.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Blowback and Calamity Spice Up the Story
> As the GM, remember that the consequences from blowback and calamity can't be resisted, though any consequences in following scenes can be. You can use this to force interesting scenes like capturing a PC or starting a fire, but be careful to choose things that are interesting to play through. If players think a scene just feels unfun, maybe work together to come up with a better idea.

## Readying the Assault

With the werewolf terrorizing the countryside for several full moons and an invasion defeated, the PCs' turn their thoughts to finishing their master plan. On the next full moon, it'll be time to strike at the town and drive them from the region.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: Alright, downtime - what are you all up to? Ulrot, wanna get us started?
> 
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I need new minions, so I head out to that orc tribe again and spend a gold there. I'm just re-recruiting the same kind of raiders as before. When we get back to the dungeon, I pay them another gold to ***Smash*** together the battering ram.
>
> **Ulrot rolls 2d Smash for his minions and gets a mixed!**
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Just barely enough to finish off that clock. They spend way, way too long putting the wheels on it. They put one on, then move to the next while the first wheel falls off, sometimes rolling down the hill. This just kinda repeats for a while.
>
> **GM**: How about your downtime action?
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Ah right. I head into the prison to pay that monk a visit. I want to torture him into telling us what he knows about the werewolf. I guess I'll ***Smash*** some fingers until he starts talking.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, just remember that without a torture chamber, you don't have <ins>dominant</ins> position.
> 
> **Ulrot rolls 3d ***Smash*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Okay, I think this is pretty straightforward and won't go into detail here, but it involves broken bones, not as much information as I'd like, and losing my temper. What does he tell me?
>
> **GM**: I'm using some pocketed minor blowback here. He tells you that they have the dire wolf caged in town. An augurer identified it as the source of the curse and believes it'll lure in the werewolf. Then suddenly, fearing he might say too much, the monk then bites his own tongue off.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Dammit! Well, that gives me an idea, though. I'm going to contact the dire wolf's pack and try to get them to run rampant through the town with us. I want to ***Invoke*** wildheart to do this.
>
> **GM**: Getting the pack to do your bidding is a tier 3 spell again.
>
> **Crag rolls 1d ***Invoke*** (3d - 2d) and gets a failure!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Screw that, I'm gonna risk it and roll again without <ins>dominant</ins> position. I think as I approach them, they're obviously on edge, growling. I put up my hands, non-threatening, and explain what's going on.
>
> **Crag rerolls 1d Invoke and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: The wolves leap at you and you're sure you're about to get ripped to shreds, but another wolf backs them off. It scares the hell out of you and you take shock to GUTS, but you're alive and they're listening.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: "Strike the town on the next full moon, but wait until you see fire. That's the signal." I then back slowly away.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: "Well, we're not gonna be needing this tongueless monk anymore." I drag him out of his cell and haul him into the greenery. The plants hungrily snap at him, but I have a certain plant in mind - fire blossoms. I throw the monk in front of them and head off. They scorch him, then start feasting. I come back a bit later to pick some *firebombs*.
>
> **GM**: He's a tier two adventurer, so tier 2 *firebombs* work. You can harvest two, though one of them's volatile with a super short fuse.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Sounds good. I give them to Ulrot. "Here, you'll be needing these."
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Nah, screw that. I want to power struggle. I toss it back and ***Threaten*** you, "No, no, no. I think it's gotta be you riding that battering ram."
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I try to ***Trick*** you, "What are you talking about? You're heavier. It's gonna need the weight to get going fast enough down that hill."
>
> **GM**: Let's see some rolls.
>
> **Ulrot rolls 2d ***Threaten*** and gets a failure!**
>
> **Slem rolls 1d ***Trick*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: "Don't worry, you're gonna be fine. With that short fuse, remember to count to 2, not 3 before tossing it. That's the key." Now, my downtime...
