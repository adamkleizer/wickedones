# Chapter 1 - The Basics

> “That was quick. In and out, just like we planned. Look at 'em, up there, wondering where the hell we went. So how much ya think they're gonna pay for this princess anyway? Huh Spaz? Uh... Spaz? Why you got that murder look in your eyes again?"

&mdash; Brok, Orc Brute

## Getting Started

You play as monsters working together to build a dungeon and wreak havoc on the region around it. The dungeon is the main character of the story you're telling. It’s your home and refuge, a safe place to lay your head after some raiding and the only thing between you and the end of an adventurer’s sword. The dungeon grows over time and you fill it with all kinds of crazy stories, like fending off adventurers, busting the heads of your minions, or dragging in prisoners to torture. You play not only your own character, but also the minions and creatures that inhabit your dungeon, as well as all the traps, tricks, locks, and magic rituals you fill it with.

This chapter covers the basic game mechanics and how the characters work, while later chapters cover how the dungeon works in more detail. Newly introduced or important game terms and rules are in **bold** to call attention to them. New terms that are explained later in the book are <ins>underlined like this</ins>. Some terms such as actions, attributes, calling abilities, and dungeon rooms are displayed in ***This font***.

### Phases & Scenes

Gameplay follows a <ins>**cycle of play**</ins>. While <ins>lurking</ins>, you build up your dungeon and deal with any <ins>calamity</ins>. While <ins>raiding</ins>, you leave the dungeon and attack targets on the surface, then deal with any <ins>blowback</ins> it causes. A lot happens within each phase and for the most part, time passes fluidly. You can montage some action or skip around in time with PCs doing things at different times and places.

When things heat up and the action gets interesting, you zoom in to what's called a **scene**. Within scenes, time slows down and events progress in sequential order. You can still skip forward when nothing interesting is happening, but time is mostly driven forward by player action. When the starting situation in a scene isn’t exactly clear, you use engagement to clarify it. When the excitement wraps up, you zoom back out into the more fluid flow of time again. This zooming in and out happens naturally through play and doesn’t always have to be clearly stated.

**“Let’s make this a scene,”** **“I wanna see how this plays out,”** or **“What does that look like?”** are useful phrases for those times when you or the GM want to cut in and set up a scene. When this occurs, the player starting the scene or the GM sets the scene up, detailing where your characters are and describing what’s happening around you. You then zoom in and take on the roles of your characters. When other players go out of their way to join dungeon scenes, they <ins>earn xp</ins> for doing so.

You use scenes to flesh out the story and establish elements of the fiction. Sometimes a brief description and then using a game mechanic allows you to add some detail to the story without playing out the entire scene, but when you do zoom in, it gives you the chance to make that scene an important part of the story.

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I’m going to recruit some goblins from that village as minions. Of course, I’m going to pay a gold to do it but I want to zoom in here and make it a scene to see what our relationship with these goblins is like. I strut straight into their village. I think a bunch come scurrying out as they notice me, so I pull out some gold and ***Banter***, ‘Who needs a job?’”

### Fiction-First Gaming

Throughout this book, you’ll find various mechanics for how to judge in-game situations. One thing should be made clear, though &ndash; these mechanics exist to be used after the fiction has been established.

When you play a roleplaying game, you first imagine the fictional situations that your characters are in. You declare how they act and then work backwards from that to match up what’s happening “on-screen” with a game mechanic that feels right to determine how it plays out.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Rule of Description**: You can’t access game mechanics before giving at least some level of description. Even a simple one-line explanation suffices.

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I head down to that goblin village I went to a few weeks ago and talk to some of their young warriors, convincing them to join us. I’ll pay a gold to recruit them as minions.”

**You do this because every detail you can add into the fictional world helps make it more interesting.** You never know when these details might matter down the road. The core mechanics of *Wicked Ones* support elements of the fiction impacting gameplay. Actions are flexible and easy to apply to various situations, while position 
and effect give mechanical weight to narrative elements within the fiction. However, when you can’t find mechanics that match up with what’s happening, the game collapses neatly down into a single <ins>fortune roll</ins>. You can always fall back on this when you’re not sure what to do or can't recall a particular rule. Just make a fortune roll, narrate what happens, and move on.

### Play Structure

While the game works well as a one-shot or even a short length campaign, an ideal campaign of *Wicked Ones* covers about 16 sessions, which is 4 months of weekly 3-5 hour sessions. You can expect a dungeon invasion about every third or fourth session and your dungeon to increase in tier at the same rate. As your dungeon approaches tier 4, you get closer to realizing your master plan and the region around the dungeon becomes more likely to unite against you.

Throughout these sessions, your PC and minions act as your primary roleplaying tools. You can step into either role whenever you think it would be interesting to do so.

Minions are groups of monsters who live in your dungeon for pay. They are like secondary PCs and the more you make them a part of the story, the larger your dungeon will feel. Each Wicked One has control of enough hoard to recruit a pack of minions, though this doesn’t mean the minions are blindly loyal to their master. They have their own impulses and ideas, so put in the effort to make them into their own independent characters.

## Flow of Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important. While the GM and the players work together to establish the sandbox and factions within it, the world mostly resides in the mind of the GM. The GM has two responsibilities in this regard:
- **Share information about the setting with the players** so they can make informed decisions to weave a fun and interesting story.
- **Describe what a character perceives, suspects, or intuits** so the players can understand how they can interact with the environment.

Unfortunately, there’s too much going on to tell the players everything. It would take forever and be boring. So, when information is lacking, it’s up to the players to ask for what they want to know.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Simply ask the GM a question about the world when you want to learn something. Anything known by normal people living in an area should be told to the players. Everything else is **hidden information**.

Most information about the world should be known by everyone at the table, but certain information is hidden from players. This might be weaknesses in a defense or secrets the PCs can exploit. This depends on how well known the information is, though. The GM might tell the players about a huge hole in a castle wall, but detailed information about corrupt guards might be hidden. They could also reveal an open secret about a local priest, such as a gambling addiction, but shouldn't let the players know about a secret lover. Obscuring information in this way increases the challenge, protects NPC motives, and creates dramatic tension. It's the GM's job to find the right balance between what information is freely available and what needs to be gained through the methods over the next few pages.

**You can act on any knowledge you have, even if your character doesn't know it.** While monsters have extremely limited knowledge of the overworld, that doesn’t mean that players do. Choosing raid targets or finding some trouble to get up to is more fun when everyone is in the know. It’s all about making choices that are fun to play through. Monsters have an uncanny knack for showing up at the worst times and places. They prey on weakness in civilization, almost like they have a sense for it. You can use this to justify acting on knowledge that the players have but the characters don't.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "So I remember deciding when we set up the sandbox that this human encampment is on the brink of starvation. I think what I'm gonna do is go hunt down a deer and hang it from a tree like I'm skinning it. That'll lure in a couple of them for sure."

### Establishing Facts

**While the GM is the main author of the world, the players are also contributors.** You can try to establish facts within the fiction just by asking the GM a question. You might ask something like “Hey, can there be a big hole on the other side of that wall?” Then the GM needs to make a judgement call:
- **YES**: : If it seems likely or they just want to see what you’ll do, they can simply say yes. Players are very likely to interact with details they bring into the game.
- **NO**: If they don’t think it’s plausible or even if they just don’t want whatever it is to exist, they can say no. That’s well within their scope as the GM.
- **MAYBE**: If they want to leave it up to the dice, they can make a <ins>fortune roll</ins> to determine whether something is true or not.

[context]: # (important rule)
> The GM must say yes when facts are established by <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins> except when it's highly implausible.

When players ask vague questions about the world, it's often because they already have something in mind that they'd like to see in the story. This is a good opportunity for the GM to push players to establish facts by responding with a leading question like “What are you hoping to find?” or “What do you think is along that road?” Of course, if they don't have anything in mind, the GM can describe the world instead.

The players are a nice resource for the GM to tap into to help flesh out the world with details they're interested in interacting with. When describing the world, the GM can always prompt players to establish facts. When they do so, the likelihood of them bringing those details into the game later drastically increases. This also helps ease the creative burden on the GM. When all's said and done, though, it's the GM's job to tie all this creativity together into a cohesive world.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Grok**: “Hey, what’s along this road? Maybe some farms or something?”
>
> **GM**: “Sure... that seems likely. I think there’s probably several small farms around here. Did you have anything specific in mind?"
>
> **Grok**: "Yeah, I was thinking that there could maybe be a larger, fancier plantation towards the center here. Raiding farms usually isn't worth it since farmers are so tough and not really rich, but maybe there's a place here with quite a bit more loot than what a farm would have."
>
> **GM**: "That's cool. I really like that. Sounds like you're honing in on a raid target here. Want me to sketch a quick map?"
>
>**Grok**: "Yeah, if you don't mind. I'm thinking stealth or maybe an assault for the raid plan, but I wanna see that map first."

### Hidden Information

**Scouting the surface is incredibly dangerous for monsters** and if caught, you're probably not going to make it back to the dungeon. If you don't have the proper training (a <ins>calling ability</ins>), your lack of understanding of how civilization works means it's unlikely that you'll learn more than common knowledge. So even when you see something, it's difficult to put it into context and make use of that info.

You spend most of your time lurking behind your dungeon defenses, making it tough to learn about the surface. You have to rely on the following methods to get your hands on hidden information:
- **<ins>Torture</ins> prisoners** to break them and learn their secrets.
- **<ins>Contact</ins> factions or vile friends** and convince them to help.
- **<ins>Pay gold</ins>** to someone you know, such as a vile friend or allied faction.
- **<ins>Raid</ins>** a target and steal information they don't want known, using safety in numbers to traverse the surface.
- **Use <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins>**, which allow you to establish facts within a limited scope. This guarantees that you have useful information.
- **<ins>Flashback</ins>** to using information gathering calling abilities and dungeon rooms or paying gold when you need information most. A torture chamber also allows you to flashback to torturing prisoners.

When you successfully use one of the above methods to gain some hidden information, it is revealed with one of the following (GM's choice):
- **Ask Questions**: The player can ask a question or two that the GM answers if the information can be gained from that source.
- **Establish Facts**: The player establishes a fact or two about the world.
- **Reveal Secrets**: The GM reveals a piece or two of useful information.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Zella**: “I'm going to use my scout ability here to establish a fact about this trading post. I've been watching this road for months and I know at the beginning of each month, a big shipment of wine comes into the region. We need drinks for our dungeon's tavern.”
>
> **GM**: “You know, that's not all that hidden. We can just establish that that's true. I could reveal a secret about it or maybe you have an idea?"
>
> **Zella**: “Hmm, I'm not coming up with anything. What do you have?"
>
> **GM**: “Let's say that a few bottles of this wine are special. They're intended for the abbey for use in their ceremonies. Without it, the power of their god will wane in this region until the next shipment."

## Stress

As a Wicked One, you're unique among monsterkind. You have an extra reserve of tenacity called **stress** that you can tap into to exert your will, fend off disastrous circumstances,or suppress the dark impulses that lurk inside you.

You can spend stress to make use of several different game mechanics, allowing you to do various impressive feats otherwise not possible:
- You **spend stress** on <ins>calling abilities</ins>, <ins>flashbacks</ins>, <ins>resistance rolls</ins>, <ins>teaming up</ins>, using some <ins>magic items</ins>, and suppressing <ins>dark impulses</ins>.
- You **clear stress** by rolling a critical on a resistance roll or meeting certain criteria within an ability.

Stress is represented on your character sheet by a 6-segment clock. When something requires you to spend stress, you fill in one segment of the clock. Resistances are the exception, however, with the amount of stress you spend ranging from 1 to 3, depending on the results of the resistance roll. When you clear stress, you erase 1 segment on the clock. When you run out of stress and tick the last segment, you <ins>**go feral**</ins> and lose yourself to your dark impulse.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Stress is recovered in full during recovery at the beginning of the lurking phase.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I don't really have much stress left to spend here, so I'm not gonna resist the guard getting away. I'd rather save it for our own getaway. I've got a feeling we'll need a pretty big spell to blow a hole in that wall."

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Use Your Stress, Don't Hoard It!
> Players have a strong tendency to hoard mechanical resources like stress, thinking they might need it later “just in case” and then end the raid without having taken much stress. It's not meant to be hoarded like that. There are plenty of ways for each character to use it and doing so makes the game interesting. Don’t talk yourself out of doing something just because it might cost some stress. The worst case scenario is that your character will go feral - which is just more fun!

## Rolling Dice

Anytime there is uncertainty within the story, you roll dice to figure out what happens. All rolls are made using 6-sided dice and you'll need four to six of them. Any time a die roll is mentioned in this book, it's written with the number of dice to be rolled first followed by a “d,” so 3d means to roll three 6-sided dice.

Some abilities or situations might modify how many dice you get to roll. A plus or minus sign means to add or subtract from the pool, such as +1d or -1d. When figuring out how many dice are in the pool, first apply negative modifiers with a minimum pool of 0d, then apply positive modifiers.

[context]: # (important rule)
> When you have no dice to roll (0d), you instead roll 2d and take the lower result.

While there are various types of rolls in the game, almost all rolls follow the same basic pattern. There are four roll results: **failure**, **mixed**, **success**, and **critical**. You gather a pool of dice, roll it, and **keep the highest single die result**. This result is used to determine how well the roll went. A critical happens when you roll two or more 6s on one roll. A 0d roll, however, discards the highest result and never results in a critical. The result is judged as follows:

| Result | Do you accomplish the task? | Ticks\* |
|---|---|:-:|
| **Failure** | **No, and...** Things go as poorly as they could have in that situation. You fail to do it and suffer a consequence. | **0** |
| **Mixed** | **Yes, but…** You get the results, but they come at a cost. There will be some consequences coming your way. At other times, it may just result in a less effective result. | **1** |
| **Success** | **Yes!** You get the results that you hoped for! | **2** |
| **Critical** | **Yes, and…** ! Not only do you get what you want, but you get something else to go along with it!| **3+** |

[context]:# (table footnote)
> \* How many times the roll ticks a <ins>progress clock</ins> or slashes an <ins>adventurer's hearts</nis>.|

**Every action roll covers both the player’s action and the action of NPCs as well.** For the most part, players are the ones rolling dice. When a player rolls a mixed or a
failure, the GM responds with the world acting against the PCs. This is why a mixed result is the most common result in the game. It allows the PCs to work towards their goals, but also the NPCs to act in response to what's happening.

### Types of Rolls

Listed below are the most common types of rolls in the game, split between those rolled by players and those rolled by the GM. These are explained in more detail throughout this book.

#### Player Rolls

- **Action rolls** are made to do something challenging. You choose one of your actions and roll it to find out what happens. The roll has position and effect, which determine how risky it is and the impact it might have.
- **Resistance rolls** are made to resist consequences. You choose an action and roll it to see how much stress you take and how well you resist the consequence.
- **Loot rolls** are made to pull gold and items out of the loot you raided for and enjoy revelry, gaining dark hearts. You roll dice equal to the loot you grabbed on your last raid or dungeon defense.

#### GM Rolls
- **Engagement rolls** are made to determine how a raid starts off or how ready the PCs are when we zoom into a scene.
- **Calamity rolls** are made to determine if anything bad happens within your dungeon while lurking, sometimes triggering dungeon invasions.
- **Blowback rolls** are made to determine how the world responds to your raids, sometimes triggering dungeon invasions.
- **Fortune rolls** are made to answer questions about the world when the GM isn’t sure or doesn’t want to decide on their own.
- **Defensive Move rolls** are made to see if an adventurer can resist a PC action.

One thing is true for all dice rolls - they never result in "nothing happens." They're designed to move the game forward. When you're at an impasse about what the next step is, you can always turn to the dice to figure it out. An action roll is either going to work or you're going to face consequences. A fortune roll will work out for you or it won't. No matter what you roll, **something happens**.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Maybe Try Customizing Your Dice?
> The only dice you need for this game are d6s, like typical white dice with black dots. However, marking some dice with stickers or getting dice with custom sides makes the rolls quicker to parse and have a bigger impact than normal dice. It's a small detail, but highly recommended! For use with virtual tabletops, the release of the Deluxe Edition comes with dice image assets.

## Actions

**Actions** are different methods and approaches that you use to get things done. They represent a character’s natural ability or training and show what you’re good at and what you’re terrible at. They define how your character goes about solving problems.

The list of actions covers the most common ways that monsters deal with their problems, though there might be some difficulty applying an action to every situation. To help with this, each action has a *descriptive adverb* tied to it which expands on how it is typically used. When you can’t quite find an action that perfectly fits what you want to do, you can fall back on that adverb to figure out which action best applies to it.

### Attributes and Actions

Actions are broken up into three categories called attributes, which are a good indication of how the actions within it are typically used. Sometimes, attributes are hit with a consequence called shock, weakening that set of actions temporarily.
- ***BRAINS*** covers the actions ***Scan***, ***Tinker***, and ***Trick***.
- ***MUSCLES*** covers the actions ***Finesse***, ***Skulk***, and ***Smash***.
- ***GUTS*** covers the actions ***Banter***, ***Invoke***, and ***Threaten***.

### Choosing Actions to Roll

Think about what your character is doing, describe it, and work backwards from that to choose an action. Don’t think about the action first - it limits your creativity. If you can’t quite find one that fits, look to its associated *adverb* in italics next to it to broaden its definition. Matching description with actions is key, as it informs the shape success will take or the consequences that will stem from failure. Are you trying to *powerfully* ***Smash*** a stink bomb against a wall, or are you trying to *precisely* ***Finesse*** it into the perfect spot? Overlap among actions when trying to accomplish a task is normal - there are many ways to go about most things and some approaches may be more effective than others.

**The player chooses the action rolled**, which tells the GM and the table how they want to approach the task. While calling out actions to be rolled is a common habit for GMs to fall into, you should fight this urge. Don’t assume the player's approach and call out actions like, “Okay, roll ***Smash***." Instead maybe ask, “How do you go about it?” or lean into the adverbs and say “That sounds more like you’re trying to do it *powerfully* than *precisely*. What do you think?”

It’s the player’s job to tell the GM how they want to approach doing something, and it’s the GM’s job to determine how effective or risky it might be given the situation. This is called <ins>position</ins> and <ins>effect</ins>, detailed later in this chapter.

### Actions in Detail

- When you ***Scan***, you *perceptively* read situations or search for information.  
*You might roll this to scope out good targets on a road, read fear in your enemy’s heart, or pour over an archaic tome.*
- When you ***Tinker***, you *cleverly* fiddle with a device, mechanism, or concoction.  
*You might roll this to rig a cart axle to fail, place a trap along a forest path, or jimmy a lock in your way.*
- When you ***Trick***, you *slyly* deceive, confuse, or manipulate someone.  
*You might roll this to make someone believe you’re harmless, distract some farmers while your buddies loot the barn, or lose some hounds running you down.*
- When you ***Finesse***, you *precisely* take aim, maneuver, or use tools. 
*You might roll this to stick an arrow between someone’s ribs, jump from tree limb to limb, or trip someone walking by you.*
- When you ***Skulk***, you *sneakily* move unnoticed or launch a surprise attack.  
*You might roll this to slip out of the shadows and cut a guard’s throat, sneak up and pocket some unattended gold pouches, or go unnoticed in a crowd.*
- When you ***Smash***, you *powerfully* assault someone or something.  
*You might roll this to bury an axe into someone’s skull, bend some prison cell bars, or toss an exploding concoction against a wall.*
- When you ***Banter***, you *affably* get people to help you because they like you.  
*You might roll this to get a group of goblins to join your dungeon as minions, convince some satyrs that you’re not looking for trouble, or calm a giant spider down.*
- When you ***Invoke***, you *magically* interact with dark, mystical forces.  
*You might roll this to cast a fireball into a town square, dispel a ward spell on a door, or make a hippogriff back down with a display of magic.*
- When you ***Threaten***, you *forcefully* compel someone to obey or fear you.  
*You might roll this to scare townsfolk into running away, keep your minions in line, or demand some travelers surrender their bags.*

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Be a Monster, Then Choose an Action That Fits
> The game is at its best when you’re thinking in character and doing what you think a monster would do in that situation. We all have a tendency to want to roll our highest-rated actions, but you’re a monster who doesn’t think things through and half the fun in the game is dealing with the consequences! So, go ahead and have your tiny kobold roll ***Threaten*** to tell that big, bad knight that he’ll rip his tongue out!

## Action Rolls

When you attempt to do something challenging in a situation with risk and tension, you make an **action roll** to see how it turns out. Action rolls are a risk made in tense situations with something on the line. If there’s no risk, there’s no reason to roll. You can narrate what happens and move on.

As an action is narrated after the roll, the GM and player collaborate to describe what happens on-screen. Your character’s actions are in your hands and it’s up to you to describe what success looks like. The GM cuts in with NPC reactions, pulls your narration back when it stretches a little too far, or hands out consequences.

An action roll has two functions. It tells you what the PC is trying to do, but also determines the actions of NPCs and the world as the PC is acting. To fully understand the stakes in play and what might happen, each action roll has four parts that are detailed prior to the roll: **intention**, **action**, **position**, and **effect**.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Action Rolls
> You detail your intention and choose an action, the GM details the position and effect, then you roll a number of dice equal to the chosen action's rating to determine how things went.  
**Failure**: You fail to accomplish your goal and suffer a consequence.  
**Mixed**: You manage to do it, but you also suffer a consequence.  
**Success**: You do it well, avoiding any consequences.  
**Critical**: Also, you get increased effect or a secondary bonus!

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Action Roll (Process)
> Since so much is built into this one roll, you use the following process to fully establish what’s at stake before the player decides whether to roll or not. After a few times, everyone in the game gets used to it and it flows naturally in play.  
> 1. **The player details their intention**, or what they want to accomplish.
> 2. **The player chooses an action**, which describes how they approach it.
> 3. **The GM okays the roll or modifies position and effect** by considering the intention and action within the context of the story.
> 4. **The player rolls or chooses another approach.** If the position and effect are not agreeable, players are free to back off and try something different.

The roll’s <ins>effect</ins> determines how well you accomplish the intention and the roll’s <ins>position</ins> determines how bad the consequences are on a mixed or failure. <ins>Consequences</ins> complicate the situation as NPCs and the world move against you.

Action rolls are assumed to have a chance at achieving what we’d expect as “normal” results for the chosen action, but also carry the risk of something that complicates the situation. This is the default position and effect for rolls and is not explicitly stated. However, when circumstances are outside the norm, the GM can modify the <ins>position and effect</ins> (detailed later) of a roll. Depending on the situation, you might end up in a <ins>dominant</ins> or <ins>dire</ins> position, or with <ins>strong</ins> or <ins>weak</ins> effect.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Brak**: “I want to break his sword, so I'm going to do a running leap and ***Smash*** down on it."
>
> **GM**: “I think this is going to be <ins>dire</ins>. You're on a roof and this guy is a competent swordsman. Let's see that roll.

**It’s the player’s responsibility to narrate their character’s success***. Since your intention is clear and the stakes and possible effectiveness for the roll are laid out prior to rolling dice, you have a good idea of how far your action can carry. Once the roll is made, you describe what your character does.

**It’s the GM’s responsibility to narrate for NPCs, judge the results, and hand out consequences**. They can step in and modify the player’s narration when needed, either reining it in when the player goes too far, describing NPC actions during it, or encouraging the player to expand on what they’ve described.

**In this way, players and GMs narrate the results of action rolls together**. The GM should try to give the players room to narrate, then cut in with NPC actions or adjusting the scope of the action the PC is describing. Each GM handles this a little differently, but the goal here is to get players to describe as much of their PC’s actions as they can on their own. The fiction flows best when players are descriptive.

### The Scope of Rolls

Action rolls resolve several things happening within the fiction at the same time. It covers the setup of the action, its execution, and the fallout as well as anything else that might be taking place on-screen while that happens. **The world moves every time an action roll is made**. This can change the dynamic of the scene or have unintended side effects separate from what the PC was trying to accomplish.

The scope of what you can accomplish is determined by your intention, the chosen actions, and the difficulty of anything in your way. How far actions extend is up to the GM, but it’s like a short sequence of shots in a movie. Leaping across a
courtyard, over a wall, and plunging your spear into someone's heart will probably only be one action roll unless each of those things presents a unique challenge with interesting consequences. More complex intentions can be cut up into several actions or represented with a <ins>progress clock</ins>. The more difficult something is to accomplish, the more likely it is to be broken up in this way.

### Smooth Narration

Most things that take place in the game occur due to action rolls and getting the narration for this right makes the system and fiction flow smoothly. It’s nice to think about it as a movie camera controlled by a director (the GM) who gives their actors (the PCs) a lot of leeway in ad-libbing and going off-script.

#### Narrating a Success or a Critical

**On a success**, the focus is solely on the PC. The world is moving around you, out of focus, in the background, or off-screen but the camera stays right where you want it. You accomplish what you set out to do without any setbacks. **A success feels clean.**  
Describe your action, keeping the scope of actions and the position and effect of the roll in mind. It’s the GM’s job to help guide this narration and make sure it matches up with the roll’s position and effect. They might have to pull it back a little if you get overzealous, or tell you when your action carries further than you narrated.

**On a critical**, you steal the show. You have total control of the camera and your action goes better than you could have hoped for. This might manifest in increased effect or the action on-screen causing a secondary effect. **A critical feels perfect**.  
The GM is the final judge of the results of the critical, but you have a lot of freedom in describing what you think happens as a result of it, with the GM prompting you to expand on it or coming up with other ideas when you're not sure.

#### Narrating a Mixed

**On a mixed**, the camera is much more dynamic. The focus might start on the PC as you describe your action and, in the end, you do manage to accomplish it. However, things don’t go as well as you hoped and it’s the GM’s job to steal the limelight, pull the camera away from your PC, and hand out consequences. **A mixed feels messy.**  
Narrating it is a bit like improv - you need to open the door for the GM with your
narration. You know consequences are coming, so give the GM hints about what you think might make sense by mentioning some weakness, like how you leave your guard down or forget an important detail. The GM might also begin by telling you
what the consequence is going to be, so it matches up with your narration.

#### Narrating a failure

**On a failure**, things go poorly. The focus might start on the PC, with you narrating how your action starts or where it goes wrong, but the GM soon takes control and describes how the world makes you suffer some consequences. **A failure feels tense.**  
It’s the GM’s job to ramp up the tension and drama, creating more interesting scenes.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **On a mixed, an action is almost always as successful as rolling a success.**  
Likewise, the consequences are just as bad as rolling a failure. The exception to this is that a mixed only ticks a clock or slashes a heart once, not twice.

### Moving the Spotlight

Scenes are where the action happens and time passes in them sequentially, with actions or GM narration pushing it forward. Often though, multiple PCs are acting at the same
time and the timeline gets a bit messy, requiring you to rewind it a little bit and resolve what happened while another PC was acting. That’s completely normal.

Thinking about this like a movie makes it easy to imagine. When a PC jumps into action, the camera stays on them. Time goes by as they perform an action or a sequence of actions. You’re not limited to only one action - in fact, you’re encouraged to follow through or take the next step if it feels right and creates a cool moment.

If enough time has passed or there’s a dramatic cliffhanger or lull in the action, it’s probably time to pass the torch and allow other PCs to step into the spotlight. This is each player's responsibility. If you feel like you've "done enough for now" or want to "come back to this after action elsewhere," it's a good sign that someone else deserves a turn. The GM can help here, too, by panning over to a nearby PC or cut away to a PC in another location. Then when the timing is right, they can bring the spotlight back to the first PC.

**There is no set turn order**. Scenes play out with the spotlight jumping back and forth to the PC who is doing something at that moment. You can act when:
- **You take the initiative**, grabbing the spotlight and declaring an action.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - “Okay, I have something I want to do.”
>  - "Mind if I cut in here with an action?”
>  - "I’ll go next. I think I have an idea.”
- **Another player passes the spotlight**, giving you the chance to shine.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - “We need someone to bust down this door. Drak?”
>  - “I’m gonna go now, which should open the way for Melik after.”
>  - "Yo Joran, why don’t you stick an arrow in that guy real fast?”
- **The GM points the camera at you** and asks what you’re doing.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - “Hey Messa, you haven’t acted in a while. What are you doing?”
>  - "Okay, we cut to Grimmy who’s just now getting in place.”
>  - "We then see the tiny goblin hiding behind the orc. Marv?"
- **The GM keeps the camera on you** and prompts you to follow through.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - “You managed to jump on the griffon’s back - now what?”
>  - "The shed crumbles into a pile of rubble - what’s next?”
>  - "Let’s keep the camera on you for a bit, I like where this is going.”

And when there just seems to be a lull and the table gets quiet, the GM has a few other options to get movement happening.
- **Ask “Who’s next?”** Just prompting players to act is often enough.
- **Compel a PC to act** when their dark impulse overrides their indecision.
- **Inflict consequences** from a powerful NPC. When players experience indecision, sometimes it’s fun to let that manifest as PC indecision as well and a powerful NPC should jump at the opportunity to take advantage of that.

### Sharing the Spotlight

There’s no preset turn order in *Wicked Ones* for an important reason - going in a set order creates unnatural sequences of action which interferes with dramatic pacing. You want to keep the camera on where the action’s at until it hits a nice, interesting spot to cut away from it.

However, this freeform system creates a pretty big problem. There are many types of people out there and some aren’t as likely to take initiative on their own. It could be that they enjoy listening to what other players are doing, they don’t have any good ideas, they can’t find a spot to jump in, they're used to systems with set turn orders, or they’re a quiet person in general. No matter the reason, just knowing that this can be a problem usually goes a long way towards solving it. Keep your fellow players in mind as you're taking the spotlight. Hold onto it while you have good ideas or want to see a short sequence of events through, but help the GM redirect when nobody else seems to be jumping in.

Mechanical limits like stress, shock, or being bloodied tend to push the spotlight away from more active players. This is intentional. So while those PCs may dominate a scene early declaring action after action, that can only last so long. Eventually, they’ll run out of resources and other PCs who are still pretty fresh can step up and carry the scene forward.

As a player, if you’re setting up a cool scene, open the door for other players to walk through it. Ask them directly, “When I’m doing this, what’s Gorlak doing?” or even call out their name in-character, “Hey Gorlak, get in here and check this out!” Just letting everyone else at the table know that you're interested in having their characters in your scenes makes it easier for them to jump in.

The important thing to keep in mind is that you’re all sitting down at the table to tell cool stories together and have a good time doing so. Participation in the story is an important part of that, so work together as a group to make sure that every player gets their fair share of the spotlight.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "You knock him off the wall but lose sight as he falls backwards. You hear a thud and an "oof" as he lands hard on the other side."
>
> **Ulrot**: "Okay, I want to climb up the wall and then jump on him."
>
> **GM**: "There's not a lot standing in your way, so I think you can get up the wall without a roll. Once there, you see him lying on the ground. You still planning to jump on him?"
>
> **Ulrot**: "You bet..." (grabs dice)
>
> **GM**: "Great, but hold that thought. The focus has kinda been on you for a while here, so let's just say we cut away right as you leap."
>
> **GM**: (turns to the other players) "You all see him disappear over the wall. Crag, you've been quiet for a while - what are you up to?"

## Position & Effect

**Position** is a measure of how severe the consequences will be if you fail an action roll and **effect** is the measure of how much impact you will have if you succeed. It’s the GM’s job to fully establish action rolls within the context of the fiction. They consider all the circumstances surrounding the action and determine whether position and effect need to be modified to better match what’s happening on-screen. **Only action rolls have position and effect.**

Most action rolls are made with the PCs on **equal footing** with the challenge at hand as you choose an appropriate action and have the right tools for the job. This is the “default” position and effect and it is assumed, not needing to be stated in play. Your group sets this baseline tone through play and it might vary a bit from table to table, but you can expect a “normal” level of success when you roll well and consequences that complicate the situation when you roll poorly.

When circumstances are working for or against the PCs in some way, the GM can modify the position and effect of a roll. Circumstances that might make the PC do the task better or worse modify effect, while those that make the task riskier or safer modify position. It must be clear that the PCs **have the upper hand** or are **in a tight spot** for position or effect to change. The default has quite a broad range, so make sure that you’re only modifying them when the factors have a large impact.

| | | |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Dominant | Upper hand | Strong |
| +<br>Default position<br>(assumed, unstated)<br>-| Equal footing | +<br>Default effect<br>(assumed, unstated)<br>-|
| Dire | Tight spot | Weak |
| Deadly | Very bad situation | Zero |

Before each action roll, the GM considers the circumstances surrounding the situation. The easiest way to frame this is trying to figure out if a PC is on equal footing, has the upper hand, or is in a tight spot given the situation. This advantage or disadvantage must be clear, a judgement call made by the GM. A light rain is not likely to affect the action enough, though a thunderstorm certainly would.

When a circumstance is clearly more important than others, it's considered an **overwhelming circumstance** and outweighs other factors. It’s the GM’s job to look at the broad picture and figure out what really matters in the scene.

Rules modifying position and effect are notated as such: +/-position or +/-effect. If you have such a modifier, it counts as a circumstance towards position or effect, not as an automatic increase or decrease. If you have two or more such modifiers, they combine to count as an overwhelming circumstance.

**The GM can assign these positions to better represent the risk of an action:**
- **<ins>Dominant</ins>** position is when you're clearly in control of the situation and don’t expect much immediate backlash. Should you fail, you might lose that control or suffer a minor annoyance.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You stand over the knight, their sword and shield kicked to the side.
>  - They can barely even see you, much less expect to be shot at.
>  - The water is still and all are asleep as you swim towards the boat.
- **<ins>Dire</ins>** position is when you're clearly out of control of the situation. Should you fail, you can expect the worst, a serious complication that drastically changes the dynamic of the scene.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You don't know it yet, but there's a huge dog behind that door.
>  - There's three of them, one of you, and nowhere to run.
>  - The chief levels his gaze at you and waits for your reply.
- **<ins>Deadly</ins>** position is assigned when death is on the line, like doing something incredibly dangerous such as jumping over lava or risking bodily harm while already bloodied. This is used to clearly communicate a dire situation where a mixed or failure will result in death.

**The GM can assign these effects to better represent the impact of an action:**
- **<ins>Strong</ins>** effect means you clearly have a lot going in your favor and expect things to go very well. You can achieve much more than you normally would.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You have the perfect plan.
>  - Your target is weaker than you.
>  - There’s something helping you out.
- **<ins>Weak</ins>** effect means you clearly have things working against you and doubt you’ll have much impact, probably not fully accomplishing it even on success.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You’ve chosen the wrong tool for the job.
>  - Your target is stronger than you.
>  - You’re working on bad information.
- **<ins>Zero</ins>** effect is assigned when even if you roll a success, nothing productive will happen such as trying to ***Smash*** a dragon by throwing a rock at it or trying to ***Banter*** a farmer who just saw you kill his wife. This is used by the GM to communicate clearly that the roll you want to attempt is futile.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### When to Use Deadly Position and Zero Effect
> The purpose of these two extremes is to give the GM a tool to represent, mechanically, that something is incredibly dangerous, illogical, or just impossible instead of just saying “no”. Of course, players can always try to change their terrible position or effect!

### Assessing Circumstances

These are the most common types of circumstances:
- The **action being used**, whether it’s an effective or dangerous way to go about the task or not.  
*Trying to ***Smash*** a potion against the side of a moving carriage is going to be easier than trying to ***Finesse*** it through a window slit.*
- The **scale of each side**, whether one side is substantially larger in size or has greater numbers.  
*A lone orc will struggle against a mob of townsfolk but a couple of orcs might be able to compete on equal footing against the mob.*
- The **quality of the equipment being used**, with higher tier factions generally using higher quality items than lower tiers.  
*Fighting unarmored townsfolk with pitchforks is one thing, but fighting a well-equipped squad of the baron’s soldiers is quite another.*
- The **skill of the opponent**, with an extreme gap in skill placing a character into a better or worse position, such as using low action ratings against highly skilled opponents or high action ratings against completely untrained ones.  
*A kobold with a handaxe and no experience with it is going to struggle against a seasoned guard, but will have no problem killing townsfolk.*
- **Defenses and resistances**, with armor and shields being obvious, but also other things like keen ears, an acute mind, or being fearless factoring in.  
*An anti-magic field is going to severely dampen or negate the effect of magic.*
- The **strength of the magic in use**, as more powerful magical effects have an advantage over weaker ones.  
*Dispelling a minor illusion someone just created is much easier than dispelling one concealing a hidden entrance for hundreds of years.*
- **Environmental factors** which could affect one side or the other.  
*Sneaking through a well lit room full of people isn’t going to go as well as creeping down an empty, darkened hallway.*
- **More specific situations** like having the exact perfect tool for the job or knowing a secret that comes into play. Having wrong information puts you at a disadvantage, though.  
*Your troll buddy told you that the orc queen loves to be flattered - a fact that couldn’t be further from the truth. She does, however, love war stories and gambling.*

At first, the relationship between all of these factors can be a bit much, but with practice, it becomes second nature. When the situation is unclear and you don’t have a clear picture of the fiction, you can make use of a quick **engagement roll** to help set the initial details of a scene.

#### Reflecting the fiction

[context]: # (example of play)
> You pull your axe and face off against a guard. Both of you have appropriate weapons and armor for a fight. Nothing is modifying position or effect yet. However, things might be different if:  
**\+** **<ins>Dominant</ins> position**:  
*They haven't noticed you yet.*  
*They don't have a weapon.*  
*You have the high ground.*  
**\-** **<ins>Dire</ins> position**:  
*They've tripped you and now stand over you.*  
*They have another guard flanking you.*  
*You're fighting on a precarious ledge.*  
**\+** **<ins>Strong</ins> effect**:  
*They're not wearing any armor at all.*  
*One of your allies is flanking them.*  
*You're jumping down at them from a ledge above.*  
**\-** **<ins>Weak</ins> effect**:  
*They're carrying a shield.*  
*You were poisoned earlier in the day and haven't recovered.*  
*You realize that you dropped your axe in the courtyard.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> You try to negotiate with a goblin chief to have him bolster a pillaging raid you're planning. The goblin chief is indifferent towards you. You start off on equal footing, but things might be different if:  
**\+** **<ins>Dominant</ins> position**:  
*Your dungeon is much higher tier than their faction.*  
*You come bearing gifts that appeal to their desires.*  
*You arrange the meeting within your dungeon sanctum.*  
**\-** **<ins>Dire</ins> position**:  
*Their faction is higher tier than your dungeon.*  
*The goblins worship Labisha, the flesh eater, and are starving.*  
*You meet inside the chief's hut inside the goblin village.*  
**\+** **<ins>Strong</ins> effect**:  
*A vile friend introduces and vouches for you.*  
*The goblins have long warred with your raid target.*  
*Your reputation for holding up your end of bargains precedes you.*  
**\-** **<ins>Weak</ins> effect**:  
*You have taken many of their warriors as minions in the past.*  
*Another faction has warned the goblins of your treachery.*  
*The goblins have no good reason to raid alongside you.*

### Engagement

Any time the circumstances in a scene are unclear, the GM rolls engagement to set the stage and figure out how things begin. This could be the beginning of a raid, a fight erupting, hiding from a griffon circling overhead, or striking up a conversation with a spider queen. Engagement bridges the gap between the zoomed-out overall narration and a zoomed-in scene. It helps you establish just what exactly was going on when the action starts up when it’s not clear, which works much better than the GM arbitrarily making the call.

Engagement tells you how well-prepared you are for what’s to come, setting up the initial circumstances towards position and effect. Do you begin in a strong position with a lot of opportunities or is your back against the wall from the get-go?

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Engagement Rolls
> The GM rolls 1d, 2d, or 3d depending on the likelihood of
things starting in the PCs’ favor.  
**Failure**: You start in a **tight spot**, with consequences being inflicted.  
**Mixed**: You start on **equal footing**, ready to face the challenge.  
**Success**: You start with the **upper hand**, in control of the situation.  
**Critical**: Also, you get a lucky turn of events!

[context]: # (chances)
> #### What are the chances PCs start on equal footing
> | 1d | 2d | 3d |
> |:---:|:---:|:---:|
> | Unlikely | Toss-Up | Likely |

The amount of dice is determined by how likely things are to start off well. The more dice the GM rolls, the better the PCs' chances are. Before the roll, the players can talk through all of the positive and negative factors that might influence it or the GM can make a judgement call using their <ins>gut feeling</ins>.

**Positive factors** might include knowledge beforehand of an attack, being higher tier, awareness of a weakness, having help from those outside your dungeon, environmental factors that make your job easier, or coming up with the perfect plan against the perfect target.

**Negative factors** might include outside forces other than your opponent acting against you, bad information, being lower tier, environmental factors that hinder you, or coming up with a plan the opponent is well-defended against.

Engagement rolls are usually a toss-up, with 1d and 3d rolls being made to represent very clear advantages or disadvantages, usually requiring a very strong factor or a couple of lesser ones.

#### Skipping to the Good Stuff

Beyond setting up the initial details, the engagement roll lets us skip past several less-than-exciting elements of gameplay. It sets up a scene already in action with the build-up or approach to it being covered by the roll. Don’t describe how you got somewhere - roll engagement to see what is happening when you get there.

Later in the raiding section, you’ll see clear methods for skipping any but the most basics of planning and then filling in the details with flashbacks as you go along. This style of play is intentional, letting you jump straight into action-packed scenes and avoiding a lot of deliberation and sometimes pointless discussion prior to a raid. It’s the GM’s job to push players towards action by grabbing the dice and rolling engagement.

[context]: # (example of play)
> The PCs are walking down a forest path when they’re about to be ambushed by two adventurers. They’re higher tier than you, but a vile friend told you they were coming so the GM rolls 2d. On a failure, you don’t notice the rogue hiding to your left as a paladin steps into the road. On a mixed, you manage to pull your weapons in time, spotting both. On a success, you hear the paladin coming and can get the drop on her! On a critical, the paladin removes her helmet, revealing the face of a grinning orc - your vile friend! She levels her sword at the hidden rogue.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Your dungeon failed its calamity roll and something has gone awry while you were brewing a potion, suddenly engulfing the dungeon laboratory in flames. Potions are highly dangerous, so the GM rolls 1d to see how this starts. On a failure, you’ve been engulfed in flames and are bloodied. On a mixed, the fire has enveloped the room and you’re standing in the center of it. On a success, you see the potion start to billow smoke, about to blow! Unfortunately, 1d rolls can't result in criticals!

[context]: # (example of play)
> The PCs are doing a quick assault on a river boat, planning to jump on the boat from the trees over the river. The boatsmen weren’t expecting it and are a lower tier enemy so the GM rolls 3d. On a failure, half of you have missed the boat entirely. On a mixed, you’ve landed on the deck but the boatmen saw you coming. On a success, you’ve surprised them! On a critical, you’ve noticed the boatmen are starting to brawl amongst themselves
over something!

## Consequences

Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict **consequences** on the PCs, the dungeon, or its inhabitants. The GM determines consequences based on the severity of the situation or the position of an action roll. You can also **resist** consequences you don’t want by spending stress and rolling an action to either reduce the impact of the consequence or possibly even avoid it completely.

| |
|:--:|
| Reduced effect |
| Worse position |
| Shock |
| Bloodied / Death |
| Complications |

[comment]: | (the next paragraph mentions upper-right, in markdown it's just above)

Consequences fall into the categories to the upper-right. Most commonly, they stem from action rolls and their severity is based on that roll’s position, as follows:
- **Annoying**: A consequence in <ins>dominant</ins> situations is a minor setback, or losing control of the situation. It's annoying, but only hinders you slightly.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - The prisoner pulls a shiv from its hiding spot.
>  - The guard spots something moving and comes to investigate.
>  - The merchant ducks into his tent, out of sight.
- **Frustrating**: A consequence from most action rolls presents some kind of trouble. It complicates the situation and makes your life tougher. It's frustrating and difficult to ignore. This is the default severity.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You stumble back, dropping your bow into the river.
>  - The dogs catch your scent and have you cornered.
>  - Your greedy minions run off to find some loot.
- **Devastating**: A consequence in <ins>dire</ins> situations dominates the scene, drastically changing its dynamic. It's devastating and demands your attention.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - The knight plunges his lance deep into your chest.
>  - Your fireball misses, hitting your allies.
>  - The bugbear tribe pulls out of the deal.

A well-chosen consequence is one that really makes you weigh taking stress to resist it versus just accepting it. That’s why, by default, consequences are frustrating. They’re meant to stand in your way and make the story more interesting.

### Reduced Effect

This consequence represents impaired performance. Your action isn’t as effective as you anticipated. A mixed result on an action roll can sometimes lead to the action not achieving as much as you expected, essentially giving it -effect after the roll. If it was <ins>strong</ins> before, it's now normal. If it was normal, it's now <ins>weak</ins>.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Your weapon doesn’t fully penetrate their armor.
> - You only make it halfway up the cliff.
> - The goblin king won't lend you his wargs yet, but he's still listening.

### Worse Position

This consequence represents losing control of the situation - the action carries you into a more dangerous position. You lose your <ins>dominant</ins> position as risk is introduced into the scene, or a risky situation becomes <ins>dire</ins> with your back against the wall. A <ins>dire</ins> situation could even possibly devolve into a <ins>deadly</ins> one.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You slip and fall, hanging from a tree branch.
> - The log you’re riding on slams into a rock, throwing you into the river.
> - Your shield goes flying out of your hands.

### Shock

This consequence represents temporary physical or mental
conditions. It's quickly shaken off, only hindering you for a short time. Shock covers things like light wounds, but also psychological effects such as being scared, nervous, confused, or frustrated as well as physical ailments like feeling sick, seeing stars, or having dirt thrown in your eyes.

When you take shock, the GM determines which attribute it affects, flowing from the fiction. Shock might even affect a couple of attributes if the consequence is severe enough. The GM might also give the choice to the player, who then chooses what type of shock their PC was most likely to be affected by, given the situation. Once the attribute is determined, the GM or player narrate what happened.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Shock**: You take -1d on the next action or resistance roll with any action belonging to the attribute affected by shock. The shock clears after the roll.

- Shock to ***BRAINS*** affects a character’s smarts, awareness, or insight. These strike at your mind, making it harder to think.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You become confused by a riddle.
>  - You wake up with a huge hangover.
>  - You're stunned by a punch to the side of your head.
- Shock to ***MUSCLES*** affects a character’s strength, agility, or speed. These strike at your body, making it harder to move well.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You twist an ankle jumping from the ledge.
>  - You get sick to your stomach after drinking a potion.
>  - You take a deep cut in a non-vital area.
- Shock to ***GUTS*** affects a character’s personality, mettle, or magical ability. These strike at your spirit, making it harder to impose your will.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - You get scared by the griffon flying overhead.
>  - You feel betrayed by your minions running away.
>  - You grapple with an overflow of arcane energy.

If you take shock to an already affected attribute, you instead have to pay cost. Any remaining shock clears completely during recovery.

### Bloodied / Death

**Bloodied** represents a significant injury, putting you just one step away from death. Shock is for painful, but minor injuries. Bloodied is for the big stuff.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - A sneaky rogue sticks a dagger in your ribs.
> - A warhorse kicks you in the head.
> - A giant tramples you underfoot as you hide in the bushes.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Bloodied**: You immediately take shock to all attributes and remain bloodied until all shock has been cleared. During this time, if you receive another significant wound, you die.

If you manage to push through and clear shock from each attribute, you recover and are no longer bloodied. Monsters can shake off heavy wounds quickly, not seeming to mind too much if they’ve had a sword stuck through them or ignoring a wound until it stops bleeding. However, while you're bloodied, you’re vulnerable. Taking another equivalent wound kills you immediately - though death can also be <ins>resisted</ins>.

**When an action could result in death, the position of the roll is <ins>deadly</ins>**. This clearly communicates that death or an equally terrible fate is on the line. The choice to go through with the action is a big one and the player needs to understand clearly what might happen should they fail. It also quickly ramps up the tension!

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Death Knell**: When you die and have dark hearts remaining, you can perform an immediate final action before you kick the bucket. You take +1d on the roll for each dark heart you have. Any ally that sees it gains a dark heart.

There are other ways to bypass being bloodied and go straight to death. Progress clocks, like a clock for drowning, might inflict death when it is full. Death could also be offered as a dark bargain, given the right circumstances.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### To Kill a Wicked One
> Death is a part of monster life and the dungeon is bigger than any one PC. As the GM, don’t hesitate to throw death in your players’ faces. They know the stakes going in and the world is cruel and harsh towards monsters. Make sure they feel that. That said, shock and bloodied are sometimes the least interesting consequences, so mix it up, leaning into complications and giving players interesting situations to deal with.

### Complications

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem - the target gets away, your axe breaks, it starts raining heavily, or you get lost in the woods. They might also choose to telegraph incoming danger, starting a clock or giving advanced warning of something about to strike. Complications should push PCs towards action, re-evaluating their approach
or pivoting to deal with the developing situation.

Sometimes, the GM ticks a progress clock or makes a new one and ticks it to represent the complication building over time. When they do so, the amount of ticks generally depends on the severity of the consequence. Annoying consequences might tick it once, frustrating twice, and devastating ones usually finish the clock.

**Complications are the most common consequence handed out.** They can be almost anything arising from the fiction, such as some of the ideas below:
- You **lose an item**, either temporarily or permanently.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - The dogs wrestle the bow out of your hands.
>  - Your flamespitter runs out of fuel.
>  - You lose a gold as coins fall out of your pocket.

### Determining Consequences

It’s the GM’s job to hand out consequences and, in doing so, set the tone of the game. Choosing interesting consequences is a bit of an art, relying heavily on developing a good <ins>gut feeling</ins> for consequences that feel appropriate and flow from the story. The severity levels are intentionally vague, giving the GM a lot of flexibility.

| Annoying | Annoying / Frustrating | Frustrating | Frustrating / Devastating | Devastating |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Lose Dominant position|Reduced Effect|Position becomes Dire| Bloodied | Bloodied + Complication |
|Complication | Shock | Reduced Effect + Complication | | Death |
| | | Shock + Position becomes Dire | | |
| | | Shock + Complication | | |

[comment]: # (following paragraph speaks about diagram to the right, it is the table above instead here and is oriented left-to-right instead of high-to-low)

The diagram to the right visualizes this flexibility to adjust consequences based on tone and the fiction. The consequences listed higher on the diagram are "light" and those lower are "harsh." By default, the examples within this book present a gritty world that’s unkind to monsters. This works well, incentivizing them to build a dungeon and making them fear exposure on the surface. However, if you want a lighter, more pulp action feel, you can lighten up consequences or split them up and spread them around a bit more.

**Frustrating consequences are the most common**, as they stem from a default roll with no modifier to position. As you can see, frustrating overlaps with both annoying and devastating meaning the consequences there can be assigned for either severity. It really depends on the nature of the consequence as something that’s frustrating for one PC might be merely annoying for another.

[context]: # (example of play)
> When a huge Brute takes shock to ***BRAINS***, it’s barely an annoyance as they have no dots in any of those actions anyway. On the other hand, when a Crafter takes shock to ***BRAINS***, it’s frustrating since they rely so heavily on those actions.

**When possible, match consequences to the player’s narration.** You decide the consequences after the roll because they may change depending on how the player narrates their action. This helps the consequences flow better from the fiction. You might also announce the consequences first, so the player can match their narration to what is going to occur to them.

The flexibility in assigning consequences also allows you to adjust to the tone of your campaign or scene. These are rough guidelines and not all possible combinations are listed on the diagram. The flexibility also builds in room for surprise, allowing for harsher or lighter consequences than might be expected.

### Best Practices

Handing out well-chosen consequences relies on a good <ins>gut feeling</ins>. It’s not mechanical, so don’t try to calculate exactly what should go wrong in a given situation. Take a broad view of what’s happening when you give position, then try to internalize the principles below and the diagram to the left so you can trust your gut to hand out consequences that feel right in the situation.

1. **Consequences introduce change and challenge to the scene.** They keep the action moving, ramp up the drama, and make the world feel real and dangerous. When a PC fails, their circumstances change. Consequences should deter them from their goals or light a fire under them to move faster.
2. **Consequences don’t negate a successful roll.** On a mixed, a PC still accomplishes what they wanted to do. If a PC is sneaking through a corn field, the complication can’t be that they got spotted. It could, however, be that they made a bit of noise and now there’s a dog awake and wandering around.
3. **Consequences don’t need to be tied directly to what triggered them.** They usually flow naturally from whatever caused them, but they can also represent things happening off-screen, foreshadowing, outside interference, or bad luck. This makes for a great fallback when nothing comes to mind.
4. **Consequences might affect PCs other than the one that triggered them.** A PC’s actions can harm their allies or open up opportunities for enemies to move against them. A Hunter missing as they shoot into melee might stick their friend with an arrow or a Brute might ruin a Conniver’s negotiation.
5. **Consequences can be split up into a few lighter ones.** Multiple things can happen at the same time as the world moves. Generally, these should be split up into less severe consequences than the original. Several PCs might also be affected by the same consequence.
6. **Consequences are open to discussion.** When in doubt, the GM can ask the players what consequences they think would work well. As players, if a consequence doesn’t feel right, pause the game and talk it out with the table. The GM makes the final call, but everyone’s voice should be heard.

### Inflicted Consequences

The world is a dangerous place and it's often more powerful or better prepared than the PCs. To represent this, the GM has the power to inflict consequences any time they deem it appropriate, as long as they flow from the story and fit the tone of the game. Inflicted consequences are a powerful tool that are meant to put the PCs immediately on the defensive. They're best used in high impact situations and sometimes force the PCs to resist before they can take action. They can represent things like:
- **Powerful enemies or magic items** inflicting their will, putting the PCs into a defensive position.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - A barbarian king charges and hacks your shield in half.
>  - A magic ring detects your presence and holds you in place.
>  - A nymph’s beauty is overwhelming, preventing you from attacking.
- **Environmental hazards** that are out of the PCs’ control, setting the stage for a chaotic situation.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - The boat lurches occasionally, sweeping everyone off their feet.
>  - A heavy fog sweeps in making it nearly impossible to see.
>  - Dawn breaks and people begin leaving their homes for work.
- **Clever NPCs** lying to or manipulating you, keeping you from what you want.

[context]: # (list of examples)
>  - The prisoner bites their own tongue off.
>  - The necromancer orders you dragged out of their sight.
>  - The witch swears the potion has no side effects.

These are just a few examples. Inflicted consequences are best used to allow the world to act when it’s clear that something should happen without needing to wait for the PCs to act. **Adventurers**, powerful NPCs that are the bane of a monster’s existence, each have 3 moves they can spend to inflict consequences or resist PC actions. Their very nature makes them dangerous wildcards, so keep this in mind when one appears.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Inflicted Consequences Make the World Unpredictable
> The choice of when to inflict consequences can be difficult for GMs. There’s a balance to not being too punishing and it requires a lot of trust from the players. The power to hand out consequences is about creating interesting challenges and making the world feel real. Follow the fiction and do what makes sense. Find a balance between position, effect, clocks, telegraphed danger, surprises, engagement rolls, and inflicted consequences. These are the GM’s tools and making the world feel alive, dangerous, and responsive to the PCs is their main responsibility.

### Paying Cost

There are times when you have a large amount of control over what you're willing to give up if things go poorly. Perhaps you end up bloodied, lose some gold, anger a faction, or owe someone a favor. If the GM is unclear how the world responds, they can allow you to pay cost instead of determining the consequence themself.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Pay Cost**: The GM allows you to choose the consequence most favorable for your PC in that situation. This consequence can't be resisted by you.

The GM has final say over whether you have paid an appropriate amount.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The concoction you’re crafting blows up. You could decide your PC ends up bloodied here, or maybe your minions were holding it and are splattered all over the wall instead.
> - You got fleeced by a kobold merchant. You could decide it cost you your terrifying battleaxe, or maybe you owe him a huge favor.
> - You're hanging off the edge of a cliff and might need to drop something. You could decide you drop your wand, or maybe you dangle precariously by one hand and take shock to ***MUSCLES*** instead.

This is a tool best used for those indecisive moments when it’s not really clear what the consequence is. It flows well with consequences that arise from a mixed result. It’s also used to determine consequences that arise from crafting.

When the GM asks around the table for ideas for consequences when they draw a blank, this is asking the players what they think makes the most sense within the story or would make for an interesting consequence. When you pay cost, it's a little different. You're allowed to choose what's best for your PC.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "The greater demon claws its way out of the pit and gazes at the summoning circle. Its eyes come to rest on a certain part and you look down to see the circle has a flaw. The demon is not contained. It looks at you and growls, 'Tell me, mortal, what price will you pay for your life?'"
>
> **Zanzou**: "Oh shit..."
>
> **GM**: "Yeah, this thing is summoned and still going to wreck the town as you hoped, but you're going to need to pay devastatingcost here for your mixed. It's gotta be something valuable."
>
> **Zanzou**: "I take the bloodseeker amulet from around my neck andhold it up. 'Will this cover it?'"
>
> **GM**: "It snatches it from your hand with a wicked grin."

## Resistance Rolls

When something bad happens to you or those nearby, you can spend stress to either **partially** or **fully resist** the consequence. Describe what you do to resist it and choose an action that matches that description, following these three rules, which the GM has final say on:
- **It makes sense** as a viable way to reduce the impact or avoid the consequence.
- **It wouldn’t have <ins>weak</ins> effect** as an action roll in the same situation.
- **It’s not the same action** that triggered the consequence, but only when the PC resisting it is the one that performed the action.

**When you resist, it automatically works, at least to some extent.** You roll to see how well you resist it and how costly it is. This gives players a lot of control over the story. You can resist any consequence that you have a viable way of resisting, whether it was caused by your own rolls, those of your allies or minions, or inflicted.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Resistance Rolls
> Choose an action and roll its rating to resist a consequence. You either reduce the impact of the consequence or avoid it entirely, but take stress to do so.  
**Failure**: You spend 3 stress to *partially* resist the consequence.  
**Mixed**: You spend 2 stress to *partially* resist the consequence.  
**Success**: You spend 1 stress to *fully* resist the consequence.  
**Critical**: You clear 1 stress and *fully* resist the consequence.

### Smooth Narration

After you roll, the GM judges how the resistance affects what's happening on-screen. If you fully resist a consequence, something is still happening, but the negative effects are completely negated. With a partial resist, the GM must decide how the consequence was reduced. The GM then informs you of the end result and it’s up to you to describe how the scene played out. These follow the same basic narrative flow as action rolls: a critical feels perfect, a success feels clean, a mixed feels messy, and a failure feels tense.

Sometimes narrating resistances requires some mental gymnastics and even a bit of time travel. The consequence has already been stated - it’s what could happen if you do nothing and quickly becomes fact if nobody steps in to resist it. What you’re doing when resisting is rewinding the story just a bit and describing what actually happened. However, your action still failed or whatever caused the consequence still happened. **Resistance rolls are not action rolls. They don’t further your goals - they keep them from slipping away.** It doesn’t erase failure and, at most, puts you back to the same basic situation you were in before the consequence.

**When you partially resist a consequence**, it still happens but it’s not as bad for you as it could have been. On a mixed, you struggle against the consequences. On a failure, you just barely manage to avoid the worst of it. A mixed and a failure have the same result on the impact of the consequence - the only difference is the amount of stress you take and how it looks within the story.

**When you fully resist a consequence**, it either still happens but there’s no negative impact on you or you prevent it from even happening. This gives flexibility to make sure that the chosen action and way of resisting matches up with the fiction that’s happening on-screen. On a success, you do it with some exertion but appear in control. On a critical, you make it look easy. Both a success and a critical avoid the consequence - the difference is how it looks when you do so.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Here are examples of how different actions might be used to resist.
> - You ***scan*** your minions and pick up on them lying about the gold they stole, managing to get half of it back. On a success, you see through their lies and recover it all.
> - You ***tinker*** a chair against a door, just barely keeping the door shut but the burly innkeeper still manages to get his arm through and his hand around your neck. On a success, he’s locked out.
> - You ***trick*** a farmer that notices you sneaking through their field by making some animal noises. They seem confused, but keep an eye on the field. On a success, they buy it fully and go back inside.
> - You ***finesse*** yourself from falling off a rooftop, grabbing the edge and dangling there. On a success, you never fell at all.
> - You ***skulk*** away from a griffon diving at you from above, which snatches your bow instead of you in its talons. On a success, it momentarily loses sight of you completely and swoops back up.
> - You ***smash*** your shield up in time to keep the lance from plunging into your chest, getting knocked onto the ground and stunned. On a success, the lance rolls off your shield harmlessly
> - You ***banter*** the troll to let you pass through its caves instead of eating you, which they agree to for a gold. On a success, they put you down and send you on your way.
> - You ***threaten*** a merchant who was running away, scaring them enough to make them stumble and fall just within eyesight. On a success, they instead freeze in fear.
> - You ***invoke*** force mastery to keep your staff from falling in the river, deflecting it onto the bank. On a success, it returns to your hand.

### Partial Resist

When you roll a mixed or a failure, you partially resist the consequence. The GM decides what this means after the resistance roll, so you don’t know for sure what will happen when you resist.

**Partially resisting drops the severity of the consequence by one.** What happened still happens, but you’re less affected by it. The GM thinks of another consequence, flowing from the fiction, to represent a lesser version of the previous one. This tends to be easier with complications as they flow from the story and can usually be toned down but can get a little bit muddy when it comes to game mechanics. In these cases, you can switch the consequence to a less severe, related complication. You can also use some of the ideas below, keeping in mind that they’re just suggestions:
- **Reduced effect** might be reduced to -effect on similar actions in the future.
- **Losing position** might be reduced to dropping some non-essential gear.
- **Shock** might be reduced to a different shock that the PC isn’t as hindered by.
- **Bloodied** might be reduced to still being bloodied, but only one or two attributes take shock. It could also be reduced to just shock to all attributes, but not bloodied.
- **Losing gold** might be reduced to the PC losing an item.
- **Breaking an item** might be reduced to just dropping it.

When in doubt, you can have the player pay cost at a lighter severity than the original consequence. If nothing makes sense, you can allow them to fully resist it instead, but there’s probably always some offscreen clock you can start or tick.

#### Resisting Death

Resisting death has slightly different, harsher rules.
- **On a mixed**, the consequence is reduced in severity but still incredibly serious. Maybe you get knocked out of the scene, a clock starts as you start bleeding to death, or you lose a limb. The consequences are still devastating and the GM should make clear what the consequences will be before you roll to resist.
- **On a failure**, you still die. If you have dark hearts, perform your death knell!

[context]: # (tips)
> #### The Flow of Consequences & Resistances
> When the GM hands out a consequence, they should expect it to stand - just state it and move on. It’s the player’s responsibility to call out if they want to resist something. Reminding players a bit in the first session or two will help them build the habit, but after that it sets a way nicer pace to just expect the players to do it on their own. Players, jump in quick if you intend to resist!

### Defenses

A **defense** represents a character’s ability to dependably avoid a specific type of consequence. They’re gained through the gear you wear or calling abilities, showing how your equipment and skill allow you to prepare for bad situations.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You miss with your attack but catch the counterattack on your shield.
> - Experience lying helps you cover one up quickly when found out.
> - You stumble in the shadows, but your cloak keeps you well-hidden.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Defense**: You completely avoid the consequence as if you had rolled a success on a resistance roll. This does not cost stress.

When you use a defense, mark it off on your sheet. You can’t use it again until it refreshes during the next recovery. Defenses count as a success on a resist roll for any abilities that require one. When you use a defense, describe what happens and how it applies to the situation. Defenses are quite specific, so it’s usually clear when they apply but the GM can step in and judge any gray zones.

Every PC has one defense derived from their gear. Other defenses can be gained through calling abilities, magic items, potions, or concoctions. They offer protection against a specific type of consequence determined when you gain the defense. You might have a defense against things like minion mistakes, detection, magic, being caught lying, wounds, enemy movement, or containment.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "One of the farmers looks up from what he's doing and spots you."
>
> **Drek**: "Nah, I use my defense against detection here, pulling my cloak tighter around me."
>
> **GM**: "Okay, he stops for a second thinking he saw something, then shrugs realizing it was his imagination and gets back to work."

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Not Every Consequence Can Be Resisted
> The nature of some consequences prevent you from resisting them, such as blowback, calamity, cost, and dark bargains. Others, though, can't be resisted due to weak effect. You can't stop a rainstorm from coming or the sun from rising. You could maybe try rushing to get the job done before it does, but actually stopping it isn't possible. GMs should keep this in mind and make sure to enforce it in play to establish the world as a dangerous place.

## Dark Impulses

Your **dark impulse** is the deepest, darkest, most terrible part of yourself - it’s what makes you a monster. It constantly beckons to you, leading you astray and ruining the best laid plans. It pushes you and your allies into danger - but satisfying it fills your dark heart with wicked glee, empowering you.

[comment]: # (following paragraph speaks about the list to the right but it is a table above instead here)

Each PC has a dark impulse chosen from the list to the right at character creation. When you choose your impulse, you write in a bit of detail about how it tends to manifest for your PC, making it easier for you and the GM to weave it into the story. You can also work with the GM to come up with your own impulses if you have a specific concept in mind.
- Bigmouth: You can’t hold your tongue, whether that means being obnoxiously rude, a horrendous braggart, a nonstop liar, or you can’t help but let the truth slip out. You delight in people hearing you speak, no matter whether it hurts you, them, or your allies.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You tell the wyrm it had better watch how it speaks to you.
> - You blurt out where you’re hiding the princess.
> - You brag that you’re sure you could jump over the chasm.
- Cruel: You enjoy the pain and misery of others, going out of your way to make sure they experience it. Simply killing isn’t enough - that tends to be an end to the cruelty. But the face of someone watching those they care about die? That’s perfect. The pain of others helps you justify your own wretched existence.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You cut off the farmer’s fingers and feed them to his pigs.
> - You let the eyeless prince live, knowing they'll never become king.
> - You twist the knife just to hear your victim scream.
- Deranged: You find joy in the most bizarre, disturbing things. You either don’t care or don’t realize how your derangement effects those around you. You're almost completely unpredictable, with a tendency to try unusual things just to see what happens. You might hear voices that push you towards these actions or maybe it’s just extreme curiosity.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You find a potion without a label and take a swig.
> - You kick your minions down the hole to see what’s down there.
> - You grab a dog by its tail and toss it at the farmers.
- Fickle: You’re easily distracted and can’t manage to stay on task. Once something grabs your attention, you can’t help but check it out. You might change your mind halfway through a plan or even before taking the first step. Your attitudes towards others are just as tentative as your actions.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You should be watching the road as you go check out a bee hive.
> - Bored of listening, you let the wolf devour the prisoner.
> - You decide you’d rather not pay the goblins you hired.
- Obsessed: You're prone to fixation. Once you have an idea in your mind, you can’t let it go. You might have some object or concept which has had your attention for quite some time, or this might manifest as a predilection towards obsession. Either way, once it’s on your mind, you can’t ignore it.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You're overwhelmed with the desire to procure shiny things.
> - You're determined to feast with Labisha in the afterlife.
> - You will do anything to make sure the valley elves suffer.
- Paranoid: You always feel like your life, belongings, or goals are under threat. You never feel safe and find the slightest reason to fear for the worst. You believe that something or someone is out to get you. Your paranoia might be a general attitude, or towards something specific. You might have an irrational fear of something seemingly mundane or an incredibly averse fear of something somewhat dangerous.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You refuse to cross the river, terrified of water sprites.
> - You're sure the vampire will double-cross you.
> - You always think your minions are holding back some loot.
- Reckless: The last thing you think about is the consequences. You’re impatient, rash, and short-sighted. You take the quickest possible route to your goals, no matter what’s in the way. You care little for not only your own safety, but that of those around you as well.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You jump straight into the pike wall, swinging your scythe wildly.
> - You grow tired of listening and snatch the potion from the witch.
> - You never miss an opportunity to test out your contraptions.
- Vengeful: You never forget someone who has wronged you and don’t let any slight go unpunished. Whether the injury was real or just perceived matters little - you know they’re responsible and they will pay. The severity of your vengefulness might range from petty to extreme.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You flip the fisherman’s boat because they almost hit you.
> - You send the goblins who badmouthed you right into a trap.
> - You run off into the forest to kill the horse that trampled you.

### Dark Hearts

**Dark hearts** are bankable dice earned when you play into your dark impulse, spend <ins>loot</ins> on revelry, or from some <ins>calling abilities</ins>. You can have a maximum of two dark hearts at a time, losing any extra you earn.

[context]: # (important rule)
> You can spend a dark heart and take +1d to an action or resistance roll. You can only spend one dark heart per roll.

### Compelling Impulses

Your dark impulse is always beckoning you towards action. To represent this, whenever there is an interesting opportunity for it to take hold of your PC, the GM can **compel** you to act on it. They suggest a course of action which plays into your dark impulse and you have to make a choice:
- **Follow through on the impulse** and gain a dark heart afterwards.
- **Suppress the impulse** by taking stress, describing how you suppressed it.

These compels always put your goals at risk in some way, either by pulling you away from them or acting in mechanically inefficient ways.

[context]: # (example of play)
>It might be wise to be patient waiting for the chief to arrive, but a reckless Brute would instead pound on the table and demand they hurry.

While it’s not required, getting a dark heart usually requires an action roll to put things at risk or a sacrifice of some sort, like sending minions to their deaths or giving up some loot you’re carrying. That risk may actually come from inaction, though, with the GM compelling you to not follow through on a declared action because of your impulse. The key is that you earn a dark heart when you step away from what you’re supposed to be doing and really get back to the basics of being a monster, the things that fill your dark heart with glee.

[context]: # (important rule)
> If you feel like the compel doesn’t really reflect the way that the impulse manifests for your character, you can work with the GM and other players at the table to come up with an equally disruptive and interesting compulsion.

**As a player, you can compel your own PC into disruptive action**, pushing you away from your goals at inopportune moments that increase drama and tension. If you do so, you can earn a dark heart just as if the GM had introduced the compel. While it often makes sense to weave your impulses into your roleplaying, you only earn dark hearts when it puts the current goals of that scene or your dungeon at risk. The GM has the final say in where this line is and what does and doesn’t result in a dark heart.

You can suggest compels to the GM for other PCs as well. If you enjoy this a lot, the ***<ins>Dark Mind</ins>*** Shadow ability even awards a dark heart for doing so!

-  The GM offers a compel and puts your PC’s back against the wall.  
*“You could go help your ally, but you’re cruel, right? I think you’d rather spend time twisting the knife on this guy you just downed instead?”*
-  A player compels their own PC bringing their impulse into the story.  
*“I’m way too impatient for this. Can I have a dark heart here if I push past the guard and enter the chief’s hut?”*
-  Other players offer up ideas that the GM then compels.  
*“Aren’t you reckless? Why not just try jumping over the chasm?”*

**Your choice of revelry can also be compelled just as an impulse can.** Each monster has a way they like to live it up after each raid. Thoughts of these good times linger and when the opportunity presents itself, even when there are more important matters on the line, you sometimes can't help but enjoy yourself. These types of compels work well when coupled with the opportunity for good loot, such as a monster that loves drinking being compelled to secure a cart full of ale barrels.

[context]: # (example of play)
> Dromin, a bugbear Hunter, is trying to sneak past a hunting party’s camp. He notices a sleeping guard next to a tree and decides to just move past him. The GM knows that Dromin's dark impulse is vengeful.
>
> **GM**: (grinning) "Hey Dromin, you see that sleeping guard there and notice the dagger at his side. It really reminds you a lot of the dagger that was stuck in your buddy Gornack’s back. Must be a common issue for soldiers in this area. Your fur immediately stands on end. You sure you want to let this guy keep sleeping? That's a compel.”
>
> **Dromin**: “Yeah, that guy’s gonna get that dagger buried into his chest. I’m going to Skulk over there and take care of him,” Dromin says, grabbing dice and marking down a dark heart.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Skitch**: "Hey, I'm deranged right? Can I get a dark heart if I just empty this bag of rats I'm carrying right into the middle of this square?"
>
> **GM**: "I don't know, that seems like it'd probably just help you guys sneak out of here better. Remember, it has to put your current goals at risk."
>
> **Skitch**: "Okay, sure. What if I douse them in lamp oil first and light it?"
>
> **GM**: "There you go. Rats can easily be explained away, but flaming rats? They'll know something is up for sure."

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Why Not Just Be Evil and Crazy All the Time?
> This is a game where you play evil monsters, right? So why not roleplay your dark impulse all the time? It’s a delicate balancing act. When truly monstrous things get their own spotlighted screen time, it makes them feel more awesome. If you throw around nonstop evil and reckless actions, it makes everyone numb to them and the game grinds to a halt - the story doesn’t move forward, nothing gets done. It’s just not very fun. Less is more. And because you're getting a mechanical reward for playing into them, the other players at the table probably mind less that you're throwing your plans away in pursuit of your impulses.

### Going Feral

You have stress to stave off your impulse, but when it runs out, you become a slave to it. After you tick off the last segment of your stress clock, you ignore any overflow. **Your dark impulse demands your immediate attention and you must act on it.**

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Going Feral (Process)
> When you go feral, the entire table can give input on what form that takes. It’s sure to be something bad that sends the plan off the rails, so it’s good to hear from everyone before you jump in.
> 1. **Play stops and a discussion begins.** “Okay, what’s the most impulsive thing I can do right now?” Replace impulsive with your dark impulse. This is a brainstorming session where everyone throws out one idea.
> 2. **Make a decision.** Take in all the ideas and choose one or go with your own. The player always makes the final call on the action they take.
> 3. **Act immediately.** You take the spotlight and act on your impulse. You can use abilities without spending stress on this action.
> 4. **Take a dark heart.** It feels good to give in, even when you fail.

You remain in a feral state until your next recovery, though you're not forced to play into your dark impulse anymore. Without stress, you lose access to your abilities and resistance rolls. Furthermore, if you're compelled, you must accept it. GMs should use this powerful compel only when an opportune moment presents itself, though.

**When you follow through on a compel after going feral, whether it’s from the GM or yourself, you can use any abilities on that action without spending stress.**

[context]: # (example of play)
> Mungus, a reckless kobold Marauder, just ticked their last stress as they resisted being spotted while sneaking out of the temple. The table starts throwing around ideas about what would be pretty reckless here.
>
> **Strak**: I guess the easiest thing to imagine is just attacking, right?
>
> **Scratch**: Yeah, but starting a fight doesn't really make a lot of sense since they resisted being spotted. I think since we want to avoid a fight, what if instead of sneaking, you just bolt for that stained glass window and jump straight out it?
>
> **Mungus**: Yeah, I don't really want to see a fight here. The window option sounds like way more fun anyway. Okay, I'm going to just ***Smash*** my way straight out that window. I wanna get out fast.
>
> **GM**: Sounds pretty feral to me! Oh yeah, jumping through the glass and out of a third story window is definitely <ins>dire</ins>, but you know, jumping out a window sounds like the fastest way to get out. Let's say <ins>strong</ins> effect.


## Dark Bargains

You’re a selfish monster without morals who would gladly sacrifice bystanders, your friends, your goals, or even your own body for short-term gains. To reflect this, anytime you roll, you can ask the GM for a dark bargain.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Dark Bargain**: The GM details a consequence - something bad happens to you, those around you, your dungeon, or your current raid. If you agree to accept the consequence, you can take +1d on the roll.

**The consequence of the dark bargain will happen no matter what, regardless of the results of the roll.** The bargain can’t be contingent on the roll and can’t be resisted by anyone. The nature and severity of this bargain is up to the GM. A good bargain is one that you have to really think about whether it’s worth it before accepting. It works best when the bargain is related to what’s currently happening on-screen, but they don’t necessarily have to be. They flow well when they’re framed as monster PCs not caring about collateral damage, but they’re also a useful tool for GMs and players to create more drama within the game.

As usual, the GM can ask the table or players can offer up interesting bargains. The GM makes the final call on what the bargain is. Usually the GM just offers one up and the player can take it or modify it a bit. You can also throw around ideas, but don't let coming up with an idea stop the game for too long. Here are some forms a dark bargain might take:
- Someone, probably not you, takes shock or gets bloodied.
- Someone, probably you, loses a body part.
- A minion pack is wiped out.
- You or a friend loses or breaks something important.
- Something lucky happens for your enemies.
- Someone betrays you, like a minion pack or a vile friend.
- You piss off a friendly or indifferent faction.
- A troublesome clock gets started or ticked to full.
- You take -1d on your next blowback or calamity roll.

Players can ask for dark bargains on any roll. They can also offer up an idea they have for a dark bargain to see if the GM is okay with it. Bargains players come up with have a tendency to be a bit too in the player's favor, so the GM might modify it to make it a harder choice.

Dark bargains aren't always easy to come up with, but don't force it! If nothing comes to mind after a few seconds of thought, make it something really abstract like -1d to blowback or ticking a clock. And of course, the GM can always say that there's not a dark bargain on the table.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Mogdor**: I drop my axe, blood gushing from the wound across my ribs. I think this is my last shot. I’m going to ***Smash*** what’s left of the cart over the edge of the cliff. Can I get a dark bargain?
>
> **GM**: How about your axe goes over the side as well?
>
> **Mogdor**: Ahhh, but I just got the terrifying edge added to it. I love that axe. Can it be my horn instead?
>
> **GM**: Nah, I think the stakes are so high here that it has to be a pretty big price. It's kind of life or death.
>
> **Mogdor**: Yeah, true. Dammit, fine... I'll take it. I can always try to get my axe back later. I think Drak fell down there earlier anyway.
>
> **GM**: Great! Yeah, as you drop your axe, it goes sliding away. You have a second where you could jump to grab it, but you know you've gotta focus on the cart. It slips over the cliff edge.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Karrack**: I want to ***Invoke*** here and bring this gnarled, ancient tree to life with wildheart magic. I kind of imagine it's just old, angry, and stubborn, so I want to send it into that village to cause some chaos.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, that's a tier 3 spell for sure.
>
> **Karrack**: So -2d for tier 3 and -1d because I have shock to ***GUTS***. Yeah, 0d isn't going to get this done. I'll dump a dark heart into it so I can roll 1d. Still pretty unlikely. Hey, I have an idea for a dark bargain. Can I take +1d if the tree is hostile towards us as well? And maybe if I fail, it still comes alive anyway but is only hostile towards us?
>
> **GM**: Sounds fun. Yeah, let's go with that.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: Yeah, this is <ins>deadly</ins>. Failure here means you'll fall into the lava.
>
> **Drak**: Then I'd better not fail. Can I get a dark bargain?
>
> **GM**: The first thing that comes to mind is the ledge crumbling so your allies lose effect if they try the same jump.
>
> **Drak**: Nah, I don't want to split us up like that. Can't take that one.
>
> **GM**: Anyone else have an idea?
>
> **Slenn**: What if you drop your holy symbol into the lava instead?
>
> **Drak**: Hah, no way that's happening. Okay, changed my mind. I'm gonna take the first one and throw you guys under the bus here.

## Adjusting Rolls

Below are a few more tricks up your wicked sleeves, giving you ways to manipulate your rolls at a cost. **Each roll can only benefit from one of the following methods.**

### Go Hard

Even in risky conditions, it's assumed that PCs want to minimize the damage to themselves. This leaves some room for extra effort. Going hard at a task means that you're giving up on the idea of self-preservation.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Go Hard**: You gain +effect on an action roll but take -position. *How do you disregard your own safety and give it your all?*

Trading position for effect is already possible with the correct narration, but going hard makes this a simple process. You announce to the table and the GM that you're very clearly putting yourself at risk to achieve a better result. If you go hard on a <ins>dire</ins> roll, the roll becomes <ins>deadly</ins>. If you can't explain how disregarding your own well-being can help you achieve greater effect, you can't go hard.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Axe held high, you step right into the lancer’s path.
> - You grab far more arcane energy than you can likely handle.
> - You toss your axe and offer a hand in friendship to the angry fiend.

### Assist

You assist another PC or minion pack by lending a hand, creating an opening, causing a diversion, or commanding them. This puts yourself in harm's way, though.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Assist**: You give someone +effect on an action roll, but you also suffer any consequences from that roll. *What do you do to give them an advantage?*

Assisting creates momentary, fleeting advantages that disappear once that action is resolved. You can assist an ally by knocking a paladin's shield aside, but it would take an action roll to knock it out of their hands. There's no need for a roll, though you can only assist someone if your approach wouldn't have <ins>weak</ins> effect as an action roll. Each roll can only benefit from one assist.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You distract the guards as the Brute barrels through them.
> - You lean out to grab the hand of the Zealot jumping over the gap.
> - You stand behind the Conniver looking menacing as they negotiate.

When you assist an ally, you describe how you help, then work together after the roll to narrate what happens, keeping in mind the PC rolling is in the spotlight.

### Team Up

Wicked Ones can put aside the petty squabbling that lesser monsters get caught up in and cooperate on tasks, though you risk stress and greater consequences in the process. You can team up with your fellow monsters when you need to join forces to maximize your chances at accomplishing one singular goal, make up for clumsy or unskilled allies, or use cooperation to have greater effect.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Team Up**: Each PC who’s involved makes an action roll using the same action. The team counts the single best result as the overall team effort. This also gives the action scale, possibly affecting position and effect. However, any PC that rolls a mixed or a failure takes stress.

You might team up to...
- **...cover for weaker allies**, letting stronger members pick up the slack.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You and the Hunter help the Brute and the Zealot sneak in.
> - The Marauder extends a hand, helping you over the wall.
> - You and the Conniver talk circles around the giant.

- **...act as a single team to gain scale** to compete with a challenging obstacle.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You and the Brute pick up the templar and toss him off the ledge.
> - Everyone grabs a hammer and starts busting down the wall.
> - You snarl at the crowd while the Marauder glares menacingly.

- **...make sure you get the job done** when you might not have a second shot.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You and the Warlock grab the line and pull the drowning Shaman up.
> - Bloodied and surrounded, you and the Shadow make a final attack.
> - The Zealot begins chanting and everyone joins in to finish the ritual.

#### Narrating Smoothly

When you team up, everyone involved takes a role in narrating the results. First, you describe your action and intention as part of the team's roll, remembering that you're all trying to accomplish one singular goal together using the same action. The GM sets position and effect for the overall roll, accounting for scale, then everyone makes their roll.

Once you know the results, work backwards. If it was a success, maybe those who rolled failures can explain what went wrong and those with successes can narrate how they covered for their allies. If it was a mixed, maybe nobody really accounted for the failures, but you still managed to pull it off. Then once the actions of the PCs are clear, the GM steps in and starts handing out any consequences suffered.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Kanzun**: "I pull out my axes and square up against this guy."
>
> **Tix**: "I'm going to assist, pulling out my dagger and distracting him."
>
> **GM**: "Okay, looks like it's strong effect as he gives you an opening."
>
> > Kanzun rolls 2d Finesse and gets a mixed.
>
> **GM**: "You're gonna kill this guy, but he strikes first. He jumps forward, slicing Tix across the chest then swings wildly and hits you, Kanzun. That's ***MUSCLES*** shock. Now tell me what it looks like as you kill him."

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "Things aren't looking great. They have a line of archers, all aiming at you. There's six or seven of them."
>
> **Remmy**: "I'm going to charge them."
>
> **GM**: (laughing) "Yeah, that's <ins>dire</ins> for sure and <ins>weak</ins> effect."
>
> **Remmy**: "Looks like I'm going to have to go hard."
>
> **GM**: "You know that means <ins>dire</ins> becomes <ins>deadly</ins>, right?"
>
> **Remmy**: "Yeah, but it's not a problem if I roll a success. I'm throwing a dark heart into this roll and I'm gonna need to hear a dark bargain."

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Yorg**: "I want to use force mastery to pelt this giant with rocks to scare it away. I don't think we can kill this thing, but maybe we don't have to."
>
> **GM**: "Yeah, they're just so huge and the rocks aren't going to hurt them enough as a tier 1 spell. I think you're going to have <ins>weak</ins> effect here."
>
> **Slisgar**: "What if we team up and blend our magic together? I'll use wildheart to make the trees thrash the giant with their branches, too."
>
> **GM**: "Okay, having scale puts you on equal footing. Let's see some rolls. It's still going to be <ins>dire</ins>, though. It's a giant."
>
> >Yorg rolls 3d ***Invoke*** and gets a mixed. Slisgar rolls 2d ***Invoke*** and gets a success! The overall result for the roll is a success and there are no consequences, though Yorg takes stress for the mixed.
>
> **Yorg**: "Okay, so I think I'm pelting it with these rocks and just when I think it's working and the giant is going to run, I realize that it's about to run in MY direction! Looks like I'm getting trampled."
>
> **Slisgar**: "As the giant takes a step forward, a big tree branch whips it right across the face. It staggers back a bit, looks at us both, then turns tail and runs off."

## Flashbacks

Just as engagement rolls let us cut ahead to the action already in progress, flashbacks let us cut back to when something important happened. Making detailed plans that might never come to fruition isn't all that fun, so flashbacks allow you to have done something in the past that your character would have thought to do.

**You can flashback to any scene that a PC of your calling would have likely thought to do.** Each calling has some examples of the types of scenes they can flashback to. So while the player might not have thought to have looked into some arcane secrets, their kobold Warlock definitely would have.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Flashback**: Spend stress to flashback to a scene between the last recovery and the present. You can flashback to perform an extra downtime action, but you must also pay cost as you overwork yourself.

When you call for a flashback, first describe the basics of what you want to accomplish. The GM judges whether it was possible and likely for a PC with your calling to think to do it. A flashback then works just like a normal scene. You make action rolls, suffer consequences, and spend stress as usual. Keep in mind that flashbacks can’t undo or remove things that have already happened.

The scope of a flashback is limited to a single scene and a couple of action rolls. Sometimes, a roll isn't even required within a flashback. You can flashback to spending gold, which includes paying minions to perform downtime actions. It's fully possible that a flashback results in failure, accomplishing nothing. The flashback just allows you to make those rolls, then have them affect your current situation.

[context]: # (example of play)
> - The Shadow ***Scanned*** a dead guard for the key to open the gate. They now make their way out of the compound easily.
> - The Brute ***Tricked*** the captured soldier into telling him where his friends are patrolling. They now spring an ambush.
> - The Marauder ***Threatened*** some local goblins to be in place, waiting for his signal to pop out and launch a surprise attack. They watch now as the goblins hit the mercenary band from behind.
> - The Conniver ***Bantered*** with the bugbear warband over drinks and dice and ***Tricked*** their leader into attacking the town first. They watch now as the bugbears die softening up the town’s defenses.

## Progress Clocks

Sometimes, tasks are larger than one action - interconnected parts of an entire plan, events unfolding over time, or a challenge quite difficult to overcome. When these situations need tracked, the GM can draw a clock and tick it as progress happens.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Progress Clock**: A circle with 4, 6, or 8 segments used by the GM to track progress over time, whether that be for a task the PCs are working on, trouble heading their way, or situations developing out of their control.

Generally, the more complex the situation, the more segments in the progress clock. A complicated obstacle is a 4-segment clock, a more complex obstacle is a 6-segment clock, and a daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock. For clocks that represent danger or impending events, the shorter the clock, the more pressing the situation is. When the clock is full, something happens: an obstacle is overcome, a situation comes to fruition, consequences are inflicted, or a goal is reached. **This can't be resisted.** The clock ticking can be resisted, but once the clock is full, whatever it represented happens and now must be dealt with. Here are some examples:

#### Fences & Dogs
[clock]: # (Fences & Dogs)
|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|x|

#### Run Down Prey
[clock]: # (Run Down Prey)
|||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| x | x |

#### Troops Return
[clock]: # (Troops Return)
|||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|x|x|x|x|x|

#### Anger the Troll
[clock]: # (Anger the Troll)
|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|x|x|x|

#### Mob of Townsfolk
[clock]: # (Mob of Townsfolk)

|x|x|x|x|

#### Harpy Assistance
[clock]: # (Harpy Assistance)
|||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|x|x|x|

**It’s the GM’s job to tick a clock so it reflects what’s happening in the story.** Clocks can also be unticked as PCs make efforts towards stopping some situation from coming to fruition. The chart below provides some guidelines on how to do so.

[context]: # (chances)
> #### How many ticks does the clock get?
> | 1 tick | 2 ticks | 3 or more ticks |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | Mixed result on a roll* | Success result on a roll* | Critical result on a roll* |
> | Minor Story Progress | Steady Story Progress | Major Story Progress |
> | *Annoying* Consequence | *Frustrating* Consequence | *Devastating* Consequence |

[context]: # (table footnote)
> \* <ins>Strong</ins> effect gives +1 tick and <ins>weak</ins> gives -1 tick (except on failure).

When you make a clock, make it about the objective, danger, or situation. Don't make it about how to handle those things. A clock called "fences & dogs" represents what stands between the PCs and getting into the farm. Don't call it something like "climb fences & sneak past dogs." Let players figure out how they approach it.

Remember that the clocks themselves aren't the goal, they're just a representation of how much progress has been made. Players shouldn't be thinking, "How can we finish this clock?" Use them to help establish a shared sense of progression.

### Types of Clocks

Clocks are meant to be flexible and ticking them well as the GM comes with practice. Ticks on a clock are based on the type of clock and what it represents. They’re a representation of the fictional situation developing and sometimes the rolls and fiction don’t quite match up. Don’t be afraid to give an extra tick, hold one back, or end a clock early. Clocks tend to work best when all can see them, even if they’re not labelled yet, though the choice of whether to show a clock or not is up to the GM. There are three basic types of clocks:
- **Objective clocks** are used to represent complex goals the PCs want to achieve, like casting a ritual, slipping through town, taking down a griffon, or negotiating peace with a tribe of orcs. You tick the clock when PCs take steps towards completing the goal, usually by making action rolls. These clocks might even be unticked when the PCs suffer consequences or the fiction changes in some way.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You carefully sneak past the sleeping dogs in the barn.
> - You break the prisoner’s spirit, forcing them to help you.
> - You manage to corner the escaped noble in a small glen.
- **Danger clocks** are used to represent impending threats, like guards being alerted, some local humans being pushed far enough to hire adventurers, or angering a dragon. You tick the clock when PCs suffer consequences or allow time to pass without dealing with the danger. The clock might even be unticked when the PCs actively work towards dealing with it.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The guards have you cornered at last.
> - The dogs chase you for hours, finally running you down.
> - The riders on the horizon arrive in time to help their friends.
- **Situation clocks** are used to represent the world moving around the PCs, like a war between two factions, a huge storm passing through, or a town building a new wall. You generally tick the clock with the passing of time or when events that affect it occur.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - The stormclouds grow until they let loose in a torrential downpour.
> - The baron’s troops finally quell the rebellion.
> - The town finishes building their walls.

### Clock Interactions

Clocks can interact with each other in a few ways that make working with them in play quite interesting.
- **Racing clocks** are used to represent competing goals, like building a battering ram before reinforcements arrive, racing bandits to a juicy merchant caravan you both just heard about, or escaping from the guard while they’re trying to corner you. The GM draws two clocks, and when one is full, that clock’s goal is realized first.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You just barely manage to gather the loot before you drown.
> - The deep gnomes win the giant spider's favor before you can.
> - You get out of town before the guard dogs close in on you.
- **Layered clocks** are used to represent multi-step, complex situations, like sneaking through town and into a well-guarded fortress, taking down a mighty knight’s defenses until they're vulnerable, or setting up a complex ritual. The GM draws one clock, then when that one is full, it unlocks a second clock. The clocks can be of different types as well, such as an objective clock unlocking a danger clock that pushes you to escape before help arrives!

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You head over the walls, through the courtyard, and into the prison.
> - You mow through several waves of halfling peasants.
> - You move floor by floor through the wizard's tower.

### Using Clocks Well

When you create an obstacle clock, be sure to make it about the obstacle, not the method. The clock for getting inside a walled town might be “Guards on the Walls,” not “Sneak Past the Guards.”

When you make a danger clock, make it about the consequence of it being filled. A clock about being detected might be “Guards Respond” instead of “Detected.” When you fill the clock, the consequence can immediately happen, or the GM can pocket it and bring it in when it’s more relevant or impactful. The consequences from a clock being ticked are almost always *devastating*, generally manifesting as complications.

Complex enemy threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own progress clock. For example, a fortified castle might have clocks for “Outer Walls,” “Guard Patrols,” and “Inner Halls” representing movement through each part of that castle.

Clocks like these, representing obstacles, are great for theater of the mind style play, where you don’t make use of maps. They help paint the picture of how far you’ve come and how much further you have to go. However, if your group makes heavy use of maps, it’s sometimes better to go lighter on clocks to represent these obstacles within the fiction and rely more on the physical map in front of you.

## Fortune Rolls

There are times where the GM needs to make a judgement call about the world and either isn’t sure what the answer might be or doesn’t want to make that call on their own. In these cases, they can make a fortune roll to see how things turn out. The amount of dice rolled is determined by the likelihood of events turning out well for the one you’re rolling for. Fortune rolls also fill in the gaps when there isn’t a specific rule or some information within the story is unclear.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Fortune Rolls
> Roll 1d, 2d, or 3d depending on the likelihood of something good happening, with the results determining how good it is.  
**Failure**: Things go about as poorly as they could.  
**Mixed**: It's pretty good, but not perfect, with a tinge of disappointment.  
**Success**: It's an ideal situation as you get what you were hoping for.  
**Critical**: Also, you get more than you were hoping for!

When the GM makes a fortune roll, they choose the party that they’re rolling for - the PCs as a whole, a certain PC, a faction, an NPC, and so on. The results are from that party’s perspective. You can also make opposed fortune rolls and compare to see how two sides fared. The amount of dice rolled can be determined by a relevant trait, such as a PC’s action rating or a faction’s tier. Without a reference for it, it can be determined solely based on the GM’s gut feeling of how likely it is to go well:

[context]: # (chances)
> #### What are the chances things go well?
> | 1d | 2d | 3d |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | Unlikely | Toss-Up | Likely |

## Gear & Supply

These are the tools of your trade - weapons, traps, lanterns, wands, rope, torture implements, voodoo masks, bone necklaces, bracers, shields - you name it. While you’re always assumed to be wearing at least enough to cover yourself, your gear and supply are all the extra or cool stuff you have that help define your character.

**Gear** covers the items that you always have on you and make regular use of. They help define your character’s look and provide you with a defense based on their utility. You can carry 4 items as gear.

**Supply** covers the things that you own or have access to but might not always be carrying on you. They’re things stowed on your belt, across your back, or in a bag. Instead of completely gearing up and declaring exactly what you’re carrying before raiding, supply allows you to flexibly pull items out of your inventory when you need them. You get 2 supply boxes and when you pull something out of supply, you mark one of the boxes. When you’re out of boxes, it means you aren’t carrying any other items. The supply boxes reset on your next recovery.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Any item in your supply must be able to be carried in one hand or fit nicely in a backpack. Items such as concoctions, potions, or anything else that is limited-use must always be placed in supply.

There are three categories of items: *mundane*, *valuable*, and *powerful*.
- A *mundane* item is just a simple version of something. It could be some rope, an axe, or a set of war drums. It might look awesome, but it functions in the same way as any other item of its type.
- A *valuable* item is something a little rare and you’d be a bit surprised to find. It might be a tier 1 item, such as a magic item, contraption, or a few doses of a concoction or potion. It could also be an item with an edge, a map with valuable information on it, or a rare musical instrument.
- A *powerful* item is a normal item with multiple edges or a tier 2 or 3 potion, concoction, contraption, or magic item. It could also be a one of a kind item that is highly sought after, a certain NPC’s prized possession, or a document with very secret information.

When you buy, steal, make, or acquire an item, you add it to your gear or supply. Items are sometimes considered as a circumstance towards effect. The right tool makes a job easier or even possible to attempt at all.

If several items serve the same purpose, you can combine them into just one gear or supply, such as writing down “armor” to represent a helmet and shield or “tool pouch” to cover a variety of minor tools. The bigger the impact a single item has, the more likely it should be listed on its own.

### Gear Defense

Monsters tend to love their possessions, clearly favoring evil style over substance, but that doesn’t mean that things chosen mostly for appearance are useless. **You have a single defense based on the items you've chosen.** It can be derived from a single item or multiple items working together, though gear only ever gives one defense total. Below are some example problems that might arise and gear that could give you a defense against those problems:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - **Minion Mistakes**: You might carry a whip, a club, or a whistle.
> - **Detection**: You might wear a dark cloak, soft boots, or a mask.
> - **Magic**: You might wear a spirit mask, a mantle, or bracers.
> - **Caught Lying**: You might wear impressive clothes, jewelry, or a mask.
> - **Wounds**: You might have heavy armor, a shield, or a defensive weapon.
> - **Enemy Movement**: You might have a spear, bolas, or a net.
> - **Containment**: You might have a small knife, oil, or spiked armor.

You work with the GM to decide what defense your gear provides you. The above are just examples and the defense could be anything you can connect with your gear. When selecting a defense, make sure that it’s not too narrow or too broad. It should probably come up about once a session, but not always.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "The prisoner breaks free and runs down the hallway. They're probably gonna make it out of your dungeon."
>
> **Thig**: "Nope, I'm going to use my defense against enemy movement. I quickly cut off their path with my spear and say, 'Where do you think you're going?'"

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "The rogue jumps out of hiding, sliding a dagger directly into your ribs. You're bloodied."
>
> **Vatch**: "I don't think so. I use my defense against wounds. The rogue thinks they got me, but the dagger just digs into my chainmail. Surprised, I turn and laugh as I get ready to bash their head in."

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "Shards of ice fly from the mage's hands, peltering you. You take shock to ***MUSCLES*** and are knocked to the floor."
>
> **Daz**: "I see the ice shards coming at me and quickly bring my bracers up in front of my face. I'm using my defense against magic here. The runes start glowing and absorb the spell. They're now ice cold against my skin."

### Weapons

Like other items, weapons count as a circumstance. It’s important to remember that almost all weapons are deadly - a dagger can kill just as easily as a greatsword. **Weapons never give +effect to attacks, they just mitigate negative circumstances.**

The most common weapons strike a good balance - a sword can be held in one hand and easily stowed away or carried while moving, but is also deadly enough to deal significant damage to most enemies. A dagger might struggle against armored opponents, but can be hidden and doesn’t hinder movement. A huge warhammer crushes through enemy armor, but could make swimming a challenge.

How ammunition is handled is up to each group, but what usually works best is to assume you always have enough until you don't. This makes for a great consequence as the GM tells the players, “You just realize that was your last arrow.”

### Steady Supply

A **steady supply** represents constant access to a consumable resource, such as a potion or concoction. Some abilities and dungeon rooms give steady supplies, but they might also be gained through in-game play or a discovery.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You discover a huge cavern full of hallucinogenic mushrooms.
> - You break the spirit of a captured alchemist, enslaving them and gaining a steady supply of one or two tier 1 concoctions.
> - Your dungeon is infested with lizards, giving you a steady supply of lizard meat.

### Shared Supply

A **shared supply** is when the dungeon has gained a resource of something and all members can access it as supply. These supplies are often represented by a clock, usually 4-segments, that you tick each time it’s used.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You make a deal with some dwarves to allow them passage for ale (4-clock supply of ale).
> - You rob a royal caravan of fantastic silks (4-clock supply of fancy silk).
> - You find a crate full of jewelry buried underground (4-clock supply of jewelry).

[context]: # (tips)
> #### What Makes for Good Gear
> You’re telling awesome monster stories. Make sure to choose gear and supply that help make these stories more awesome and monstery. Don’t get too caught up in mechanical choices - take stuff that sounds fun and cool, stuff that a monster would be carrying, and remember that most monsters go for style over substance.

## Gold

When you’re leading a dungeon, all the treasure you gather
goes to the hoard. **Gold** is a measure of how much of that hoard each PC controls individually. You can spend each chunk of the hoard (1 gold) to accomplish things without going through the effort yourself. Gold can be spent at any point during downtime or within scenes, even using your calling flashbacks to spend it in the past.

Gold is gained during <ins>revelry</ins> as you sift through the loot from your last raid. Most of the loot goes into the hoard and keeps the denizens of your dungeon in line. Gold is what’s left after that. Each PC can control a max of 3 gold’s worth of the hoard before the denizens of the dungeon and other PCs get suspicious of your intentions.

**It’s called gold for simplicity, but it represents whatever your dungeon hoards.** It could be a bag of gems, a pile of stolen fabrics, old tomes, a box full of weapons, a barrel of bones, or a bunch of goats. In the end, gold represents the ability to get others to do things for you. Small, mostly meaningless amounts of wealth aren’t tracked. Players can use these small amounts in narration without spending gold.

### You can spend 1 gold to...
- **Get a vile friend or faction to help you**, but only if it's something they'd be willing to do. Higher tier factions and bigger favors might cost additional gold.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You pay the goblin tribe to cause a diversion.
> - You pay your hobgoblin buddy to provide a small boat for you.

- **Pay cost**, though devastating cost is higher.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You have to buy more reagents after brewing.
> - You throw gold on the ground to distract the guards.

- Pay your minions to **perform a downtime action**.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Your orc raiders spend a week mining tunnels and expect their pay.
> - Your goblin smiths make you a new set of spiked armor.

- Pay your minions to **come on a raid with you**.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You flip your scouts a gold and tell them to grab their gear.
> - You give your grunts a jug of ale and say they're coming tomorrow.

- **Recruit a minion pack or attract a creature**, but only if you have an open minion slot or creature lair.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You pay some local goblins to come work for you.
> - You lure a basilisk into the lair with goats.

- **Upgrade a minion pack**.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You give your raiders armor.
> - You pull some books from the hoard and force your cultists to study the Light Tongue.

## Power Struggles

Being monsters, it’s natural for the PCs to come into conflict with each other - shenanigans, arguments, and fights are commonplace. To allow for this without making such interaction feel mechanically punitive, unfun, and something that players avoid, PCs can engage in **power struggles**. This happens when two or more PCs are at odds with each other and you need to figure out who gets their way.

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Power Struggle (Process)
> 1. **Start the struggle.** Roleplay through the initial parts of the conflict, describing how your PC tries to get their way.
> 2. **Choose an action and roll it.** When you need to know who won to move forward, roll an action that fits your description as a fortune roll.
> 3. **Compare results.** If there is a clear winner, move on. If it’s a tie, return to step 1 and narrate further, choosing a different action.
> 4. **The winner narrates their win.** Describe how you got your way.
> 5. **The loser narrates their reaction.** Keeping in mind that you lost, you get the final word on what your character does in response.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You want to assault the homestead, but the Shadow suggests stealth.
> - You want a reliquary, but the Zealot thinks a scriptorium is needed.
> - You want to torture the dwarf, but the Brute thinks she should do it.

Power struggles never have mechanical impact. PCs never take shock, become bloodied, lose gold, and so on. No matter what happens, whether that means losing a bet or getting stabbed, **nothing on your character sheet changes**. Power struggles allow you to have fun with fights and solve impasses where players or their PCs don’t agree on choices happening within the story.

Power struggles can get a bit messy when multiple PCs are in play, but it’s up to the GM to lean into fortune rolls to adjudicate this. Maybe some of the PCs are working together or maybe there’s a few rounds of arguing and fighting. The “narrate, make a fortune roll, narrate the results” structure will lead you towards some conclusion.

### Why We Fight

Running a dungeon requires many decisions to be made by the players. Discussing these out a bit can be fun, but most of the time you’re going to want to land on a decision quickly. This could be deciding what creature to attract, what the next raid target and plan is, what room to build, or what to do with all those elven prisoners. Amongst the Wicked Ones, these indecisions have a way of getting sorted out quickly. Anytime the PCs hit this kind of deadlock, the GM can call for a power struggle to get things moving again.

[context]: # (example of play)
> An argument breaks out about how to raid a ferry crossing. The PCs are in deadlock, standing around a table yelling at each other. A Brute and a Shadow start up a power struggle.
>
> **GM**: “Looks like a power struggle. Who’s in?”
>
> **Dukthur**: “Yeah, I’m going to ***Smash*** things angrily until you all start listening to me.”
>
> **Slegra**: “I’m definitely going to ***Skulk*** into the shadows here and wait for an opening. I’ll just let him get all worked up first.”
>
> **Dukthur**: “I slam my fist down hard on the table and demand a full scale attack on the ferry crossing, eyeballing each of you.”
>
> **GM**: “Let’s see some rolls.”
> > Dukthur rolls 3d ***Smash*** and gets a mixed. Slegra rolls 3d ***Skulk*** and gets a success!
>
> **Slegra**: “Awesome. Okay, I slip up behind Dukthur and put my dagger to his neck and say, ‘I think a lighter touch might be in order.’”
>
> **GM**: “Hah, that’s great. Dukthur, you get the last word here.”
>
> **Dukthur**: (laughing) “Dammit… Okay, knowing I’ve been outdone, I turn my head a bit, then glance at the slissik and snort, ‘Okay, snake - but if this doesn’t work, it’s on you.’”

[context]: # (example of play)
> A soldier is pinned up against the wall with an arrow. The Conniver and Hunter come at each other to resolve what happens to their prey.
>
> **Shriek**: "I want to put an arrow in his eye. "
>
> **Nozrik**: "Woah, wait - we need this one alive."
>
> **Shriek**: "Nah, I'm vengeful and he took a swipe at me earlier. I think I want to compel myself to taking this shot and wasting the prisoner."
>
> **Nozrik**: "Can't let you do it. Let's power struggle. I just stand right in front of you and stare you down."
>
> **Shriek**: "I've an idea. I want to ***Trick*** you into thinking that works."
>
>> Nozrik rolls 2d ***Threaten*** and gets a failure. Shriek rolls 1d ***Trick***, and gets a mixed!
>
> **Shriek**: "I smirk as you stand in front of me and pretend like I'm going to lower my bow. Then just as you move, I quickly raise it again to fire."
>
> **GM**: "Yeah, that's just too fast for you. Nozrik, how do you respond?"
>
> **Nozrik**: "After the shot, I stare Shriek down. 'Okay, I'll remember that.'"
