# Chapter 1 - The Basics

> “That was quick. In and out, just like we planned. Look at 'em, up there, wondering where the hell we went. So how much ya think they're gonna pay for this princess anyway? Huh Spaz? Uh... Spaz? Why you got that murder look in your eyes again?"

&mdash; Brok, Orc Brute

## Getting Started

You play as monsters working together to build a dungeon and wreak havoc on the region around it. The dungeon is the main character of the story you're telling. It’s your home and refuge, a safe place to lay your head after some raiding and the only thing between you and the end of an adventurer’s sword. The dungeon grows over time and you fill it with all kinds of crazy stories, like fending off adventurers, busting the heads of your minions, or dragging in prisoners to torture. You play not only your own character, but also the minions and creatures that inhabit your dungeon, as well as all the traps, tricks, locks, and magic rituals you fill it with.

This chapter covers the basic game mechanics and how the characters work, while later chapters cover how the dungeon works in more detail. Newly introduced or important game terms and rules are in **bold** to call attention to them. New terms that are explained later in the book are <ins>underlined like this</ins>. Some terms such as actions, attributes, calling abilities, and dungeon rooms are displayed in ***This font***.

### Phases & Scenes

Gameplay follows a <ins>**cycle of play**</ins>. While <ins>lurking</ins>, you build up your dungeon and deal with any <ins>calamity</ins>. While <ins>raiding</ins>, you leave the dungeon and attack targets on the surface, then deal with any <ins>blowback</ins> it causes. A lot happens within each phase and for the most part, time passes fluidly. You can montage some action or skip around in time with PCs doing things at different times and places.

When things heat up and the action gets interesting, you zoom in to what's called a **scene**. Within scenes, time slows down and events progress in sequential order. You can still skip forward when nothing interesting is happening, but time is mostly driven forward by player action. When the starting situation in a scene isn’t exactly clear, you use engagement to clarify it. When the excitement wraps up, you zoom back out into the more fluid flow of time again. This zooming in and out happens naturally through play and doesn’t always have to be clearly stated.

**“Let’s make this a scene,”** **“I wanna see how this plays out,”** or **“What does that look like?”** are useful phrases for those times when you or the GM want to cut in and set up a scene. When this occurs, the player starting the scene or the GM sets the scene up, detailing where your characters are and describing what’s happening around you. You then zoom in and take on the roles of your characters. When other players go out of their way to join dungeon scenes, they <ins>earn xp</ins> for doing so.

You use scenes to flesh out the story and establish elements of the fiction. Sometimes a brief description and then using a game mechanic allows you to add some detail to the story without playing out the entire scene, but when you do zoom in, it gives you the chance to make that scene an important part of the story.

[context]: # (example of play)

> “I’m going to recruit some goblins from that village as minions. Of course, I’m going to pay a gold to do it but I want to zoom in here and make it a scene to see what our relationship with these goblins is like. I strut straight into their village. I think a bunch come scurrying out as they notice me, so I pull out some gold and ***Banter***, ‘Who needs a job?’”

### Fiction-First Gaming

Throughout this book, you’ll find various mechanics for how to judge in-game situations. One thing should be made clear, though &ndash; these mechanics exist to be used after the fiction has been established.

When you play a roleplaying game, you first imagine the fictional situations that your characters are in. You declare how they act and then work backwards from that to match up what’s happening “on-screen” with a game mechanic that feels right to determine how it plays out.

[context]: # (important rule)

> **Rule of Description**: You can’t access game mechanics before giving at least some level of description. Even a simple one-line explanation suffices.

[context]: # (example of play)

> “I head down to that goblin village I went to a few weeks ago and talk to some of their young warriors, convincing them to join us. I’ll pay a gold to recruit them as minions.”

**You do this because every detail you can add into the fictional world helps make it more interesting.** You never know when these details might matter down the road. The core mechanics of *Wicked Ones* support elements of the fiction impacting gameplay. Actions are flexible and easy to apply to various situations, while position 
and effect give mechanical weight to narrative elements within the fiction. However, when you can’t find mechanics that match up with what’s happening, the game collapses neatly down into a single <ins>fortune roll</ins>. You can always fall back on this when you’re not sure what to do or can't recall a particular rule. Just make a fortune roll, narrate what happens, and move on.

### Play Structure

While the game works well as a one-shot or even a short length campaign, an ideal campaign of *Wicked Ones* covers about 16 sessions, which is 4 months of weekly 3-5 hour sessions. You can expect a dungeon invasion about every third or fourth session and your dungeon to increase in tier at the same rate. As your dungeon approaches tier 4, you get closer to realizing your master plan and the region around the dungeon becomes more likely to unite against you.

Throughout these sessions, your PC and minions act as your primary roleplaying tools. You can step into either role whenever you think it would be interesting to do so.

Minions are groups of monsters who live in your dungeon for pay. They are like secondary PCs and the more you make them a part of the story, the larger your dungeon will feel. Each Wicked One has control of enough hoard to recruit a pack of minions, though this doesn’t mean the minions are blindly loyal to their master. They have their own impulses and ideas, so put in the effort to make them into their own independent characters.

## Flow of Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important. While the GM and the players work together to establish the sandbox and factions within it, the world mostly resides in the mind of the GM. The GM has two responsibilities in this regard:
- **Share information about the setting with the players** so they can make informed decisions to weave a fun and interesting story.
- **Describe what a character perceives, suspects, or intuits** so the players can understand how they can interact with the environment.

Unfortunately, there’s too much going on to tell the players everything. It would take forever and be boring. So, when information is lacking, it’s up to the players to ask for what they want to know.

[context]: # (important rule)

> Simply ask the GM a question about the world when you want to learn something. Anything known by normal people living in an area should be told to the players. Everything else is **hidden information**.

Most information about the world should be known by everyone at the table, but certain information is hidden from players. This might be weaknesses in a defense or secrets the PCs can exploit. This depends on how well known the information is, though. The GM might tell the players about a huge hole in a castle wall, but detailed information about corrupt guards might be hidden. They could also reveal an open secret about a local priest, such as a gambling addiction, but shouldn't let the players know about a secret lover. Obscuring information in this way increases the challenge, protects NPC motives, and creates dramatic tension. It's the GM's job to find the right balance between what information is freely available and what needs to be gained through the methods over the next few pages.

**You can act on any knowledge you have, even if your character doesn't know it.** While monsters have extremely limited knowledge of the overworld, that doesn’t mean that players do. Choosing raid targets or finding some trouble to get up to is more fun when everyone is in the know. It’s all about making choices that are fun to play through. Monsters have an uncanny knack for showing up at the worst times and places. They prey on weakness in civilization, almost like they have a sense for it. You can use this to justify acting on knowledge that the players have but the characters don't.

[context]: # (example of play)

> "So I remember deciding when we set up the sandbox that this human encampment is on the brink of starvation. I think what I'm gonna do is go hunt down a deer and hang it from a tree like I'm skinning it. That'll lure in a couple of them for sure."

### Establishing Facts

**While the GM is the main author of the world, the players are also contributors.** You can try to establish facts within the fiction just by asking the GM a question. You might ask something like “Hey, can there be a big hole on the other side of that wall?” Then the GM needs to make a judgement call:
- **YES**: : If it seems likely or they just want to see what you’ll do, they can simply say yes. Players are very likely to interact with details they bring into the game.
- **NO**: If they don’t think it’s plausible or even if they just don’t want whatever it is to exist, they can say no. That’s well within their scope as the GM.
- **MAYBE**: If they want to leave it up to the dice, they can make a <ins>fortune roll</ins> to determine whether something is true or not.

[context]: # (important rule)

> The GM must say yes when facts are established by <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins> except when it's highly implausible.

When players ask vague questions about the world, it's often because they already have something in mind that they'd like to see in the story. This is a good opportunity for the GM to push players to establish facts by responding with a leading question like “What are you hoping to find?” or “What do you think is along that road?” Of course, if they don't have anything in mind, the GM can describe the world instead.

The players are a nice resource for the GM to tap into to help flesh out the world with details they're interested in interacting with. When describing the world, the GM can always prompt players to establish facts. When they do so, the likelihood of them bringing those details into the game later drastically increases. This also helps ease the creative burden on the GM. When all's said and done, though, it's the GM's job to tie all this creativity together into a cohesive world.

[context]: # (example of play)

> **Grok**: “Hey, what’s along this road? Maybe some farms or something?”  
**GM**: “Sure... that seems likely. I think there’s probably several small farms around here. Did you have anything specific in mind?"  
**Grok**: "Yeah, I was thinking that there could maybe be a larger, fancier plantation towards the center here. Raiding farms usually isn't worth it since farmers are so tough and not really rich, but maybe there's a place here with quite a bit more loot than what a farm would have."  
**GM**: "That's cool. I really like that. Sounds like you're honing in on a raid target here. Want me to sketch a quick map?"  
**Grok**: "Yeah, if you don't mind. I'm thinking stealth or maybe an assault for the raid plan, but I wanna see that map first."

### Hidden Information

**Scouting the surface is incredibly dangerous for monsters** and if caught, you're probably not going to make it back to the dungeon. If you don't have the proper training (a <ins>calling ability</ins>), your lack of understanding of how civilization works means it's unlikely that you'll learn more than common knowledge. So even when you see something, it's difficult to put it into context and make use of that info.

You spend most of your time lurking behind your dungeon defenses, making it tough to learn about the surface. You have to rely on the following methods to get your hands on hidden information:
- **<ins>Torture</ins> prisoners** to break them and learn their secrets.
- **<ins>Contact</ins> factions or vile friends** and convince them to help.
- **<ins>Pay gold</ins>** to someone you know, such as a vile friend or allied faction.
- **<ins>Raid</ins>** a target and steal information they don't want known, using safety in numbers to traverse the surface.
- **Use <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins>**, which allow you to establish facts within a limited scope. This guarantees that you have useful information.
- **<ins>Flashback</ins>** to using information gathering calling abilities and dungeon rooms or paying gold when you need information most. A torture chamber also allows you to flashback to torturing prisoners.

When you successfully use one of the above methods to gain some hidden information, it is revealed with one of the following (GM's choice):
- **Ask Questions**: The player can ask a question or two that the GM answers if the information can be gained from that source.
- **Establish Facts**: The player establishes a fact or two about the world.
- **Reveal Secrets**: The GM reveals a piece or two of useful information.

[context]: # (example of play)

> **Zella**: “I'm going to use my scout ability here to establish a fact about this trading post. I've been watching this road for months and I know at the beginning of each month, a big shipment of wine comes into the region. We need drinks for our dungeon's tavern.”  
**GM**: “You know, that's not all that hidden. We can just establish that that's true. I could reveal a secret about it or maybe you have an idea?"  
**Zella**: “Hmm, I'm not coming up with anything. What do you have?"  
**GM**: “Let's say that a few bottles of this wine are special. They're intended for the abbey for use in their ceremonies. Without it, the power of their god will wane in this region until the next shipment."

## Stress

As a Wicked One, you're unique among monsterkind. You have an extra reserve of tenacity called **stress** that you can tap into to exert your will, fend off disastrous circumstances,or suppress the dark impulses that lurk inside you.

You can spend stress to make use of several different game mechanics, allowing you to do various impressive feats otherwise not possible:
- You **spend stress** on <ins>calling abilities</ins>, <ins>flashbacks</ins>, <ins>resistance rolls</ins>, <ins>teaming up</ins>, using some <ins>magic items</ins>, and suppressing <ins>dark impulses</ins>.
- You **clear stress** by rolling a critical on a resistance roll or meeting certain criteria within an ability.

Stress is represented on your character sheet by a 6-segment clock. When something requires you to spend stress, you fill in one segment of the clock. Resistances are the exception, however, with the amount of stress you spend ranging from 1 to 3, depending on the results of the resistance roll. When you clear stress, you erase 1 segment on the clock. When you run out of stress and tick the last segment, you <ins>**go feral**</ins> and lose yourself to your dark impulse.

[context]: # (important rule)

> Stress is recovered in full during recovery at the beginning of the lurking phase.

[context]: # (example of play)

> "I don't really have much stress left to spend here, so I'm not gonna resist the guard getting away. I'd rather save it for our own getaway. I've got a feeling we'll need a pretty big spell to blow a hole in that wall."

[context]: # (tips)

> #### Use Your Stress, Don't Hoard It!
> Players have a strong tendency to hoard mechanical resources like stress, thinking they might need it later “just in case” and then end the raid without having taken much stress. It's not meant to be hoarded like that. There are plenty of ways for each character to use it and doing so makes the game interesting. Don’t talk yourself out of doing something just because it might cost some stress. The worst case scenario is that your character will go feral - which is just more fun!

## Rolling Dice

Anytime there is uncertainty within the story, you roll dice to figure out what happens. All rolls are made using 6-sided dice and you'll need four to six of them. Any time a die roll is mentioned in this book, it's written with the number of dice to be rolled first followed by a “d,” so 3d means to roll three 6-sided dice.

Some abilities or situations might modify how many dice you get to roll. A plus or minus sign means to add or subtract from the pool, such as +1d or -1d. When figuring out how many dice are in the pool, first apply negative modifiers with a minimum pool of 0d, then apply positive modifiers.

[context]: # (important rule)

> When you have no dice to roll (0d), you instead roll 2d and take the lower result.

While there are various types of rolls in the game, almost all rolls follow the same basic pattern. There are four roll results: **failure**, **mixed**, **success**, and **critical**. You gather a pool of dice, roll it, and **keep the highest single die result**. This result is used to determine how well the roll went. A critical happens when you roll two or more 6s on one roll. A 0d roll, however, discards the highest result and never results in a critical. The result is judged as follows:

| Result | Do you accomplish the task? | Ticks\* |
|---|---|:-:|
| **Failure** | **No, and...** Things go as poorly as they could have in that situation. You fail to do it and suffer a consequence. | **0** |
| **Mixed** | **Yes, but…** You get the results, but they come at a cost. There will be some consequences coming your way. At other times, it may just result in a less effective result. | **1** |
| **Success** | **Yes!** You get the results that you hoped for! | **2** |
| **Critical** | **Yes, and…** ! Not only do you get what you want, but you get something else to go along with it!| **3+** |
||\* How many times the roll ticks a <ins>progress clock</ins> or slashes an <ins>adventurer's hearts</nis>.|

**Every action roll covers both the player’s action and the action of NPCs as well.** For the most part, players are the ones rolling dice. When a player rolls a mixed or a
failure, the GM responds with the world acting against the PCs. This is why a mixed result is the most common result in the game. It allows the PCs to work towards their goals, but also the NPCs to act in response to what's happening.

### Types of Rolls

Listed below are the most common types of rolls in the game, split between those rolled by players and those rolled by the GM. These are explained in more detail throughout this book.

#### Player Rolls

- **Action rolls** are made to do something challenging. You choose one of your actions and roll it to find out what happens. The roll has position and effect, which determine how risky it is and the impact it might have.
- **Resistance rolls** are made to resist consequences. You choose an action and roll it to see how much stress you take and how well you resist the consequence.
- **Loot rolls** are made to pull gold and items out of the loot you raided for and enjoy revelry, gaining dark hearts. You roll dice equal to the loot you grabbed on your last raid or dungeon defense.

#### GM Rolls
- **Engagement rolls** are made to determine how a raid starts off or how ready the PCs are when we zoom into a scene.
- **Calamity rolls** are made to determine if anything bad happens within your dungeon while lurking, sometimes triggering dungeon invasions.
- **Blowback rolls** are made to determine how the world responds to your raids, sometimes triggering dungeon invasions.
- **Fortune rolls** are made to answer questions about the world when the GM isn’t sure or doesn’t want to decide on their own.
- **Defensive Move rolls** are made to see if an adventurer can resist a PC action.

One thing is true for all dice rolls - they never result in "nothing happens." They're designed to move the game forward. When you're at an impasse about what the next step is, you can always turn to the dice to figure it out. An action roll is either going to work or you're going to face consequences. A fortune roll will work out for you or it won't. No matter what you roll, **something happens**.

[context]: # (tips)

> #### Maybe Try Customizing Your Dice?
> The only dice you need for this game are d6s, like typical white dice with black dots. However, marking some dice with stickers or getting dice with custom sides makes the rolls quicker to parse and have a bigger impact than normal dice. It's a small detail, but highly recommended! For use with virtual tabletops, the release of the Deluxe Edition comes with dice image assets.

## Actions

**Actions** are different methods and approaches that you use to get things done. They represent a character’s natural ability or training and show what you’re good at and what you’re terrible at. They define how your character goes about solving problems.

The list of actions covers the most common ways that monsters deal with their problems, though there might be some difficulty applying an action to every situation. To help with this, each action has a *descriptive adverb* tied to it which expands on how it is typically used. When you can’t quite find an action that perfectly fits what you want to do, you can fall back on that adverb to figure out which action best applies to it.

### Attributes and Actions

Actions are broken up into three categories called attributes, which are a good indication of how the actions within it are typically used. Sometimes, attributes are hit with a consequence called shock, weakening that set of actions temporarily.
- ***BRAINS*** covers the actions ***Scan***, ***Tinker***, and ***Trick***.
- ***MUSCLES*** covers the actions ***Finesse***, ***Skulk***, and ***Smash***.
- ***GUTS*** covers the actions ***Banter***, ***Invoke***, and ***Threaten***.

### Choosing Actions to Roll

Think about what your character is doing, describe it, and work backwards from that to choose an action. Don’t think about the action first - it limits your creativity. If you can’t quite find one that fits, look to its associated *adverb* in italics next to it to broaden its definition. Matching description with actions is key, as it informs the shape success will take or the consequences that will stem from failure. Are you trying to *powerfully* ***Smash*** a stink bomb against a wall, or are you trying to *precisely* ***Finesse*** it into the perfect spot? Overlap among actions when trying to accomplish a task is normal - there are many ways to go about most things and some approaches may be more effective than others.

**The player chooses the action rolled**, which tells the GM and the table how they want to approach the task. While calling out actions to be rolled is a common habit for GMs to fall into, you should fight this urge. Don’t assume the player's approach and call out actions like, “Okay, roll ***Smash***." Instead maybe ask, “How do you go about it?” or lean into the adverbs and say “That sounds more like you’re trying to do it *powerfully* than *precisely*. What do you think?”

It’s the player’s job to tell the GM how they want to approach doing something, and it’s the GM’s job to determine how effective or risky it might be given the situation. This is called <ins>position</ins> and <ins>effect</ins>, detailed later in this chapter.

### Actions in Detail

- When you ***Scan***, you *perceptively* read situations or search for information.  
*You might roll this to scope out good targets on a road, read fear in your enemy’s heart, or pour over an archaic tome.*
- When you ***Tinker***, you *cleverly* fiddle with a device, mechanism, or concoction.  
*You might roll this to rig a cart axle to fail, place a trap along a forest path, or jimmy a lock in your way.*
- When you ***Trick***, you *slyly* deceive, confuse, or manipulate someone.  
*You might roll this to make someone believe you’re harmless, distract some farmers while your buddies loot the barn, or lose some hounds running you down.*
- When you ***Finesse***, you *precisely* take aim, maneuver, or use tools. 
*You might roll this to stick an arrow between someone’s ribs, jump from tree limb to limb, or trip someone walking by you.*
- When you ***Skulk***, you *sneakily* move unnoticed or launch a surprise attack.  
*You might roll this to slip out of the shadows and cut a guard’s throat, sneak up and pocket some unattended gold pouches, or go unnoticed in a crowd.*
- When you ***Smash***, you *powerfully* assault someone or something.  
*You might roll this to bury an axe into someone’s skull, bend some prison cell bars, or toss an exploding concoction against a wall.*
- When you ***Banter***, you *affably* get people to help you because they like you.  
*You might roll this to get a group of goblins to join your dungeon as minions, convince some satyrs that you’re not looking for trouble, or calm a giant spider down.*
- When you ***Invoke***, you *magically* interact with dark, mystical forces.  
*You might roll this to cast a fireball into a town square, dispel a ward spell on a door, or make a hippogriff back down with a display of magic.*
- When you ***Threaten***, you *forcefully* compel someone to obey or fear you.  
*You might roll this to scare townsfolk into running away, keep your minions in line, or demand some travelers surrender their bags.*

> #### Be a Monster, Then Choose an Action That Fits
> The game is at its best when you’re thinking in character and doing what you think a monster would do in that situation. We all have a tendency to want to roll our highest-rated actions, but you’re a monster who doesn’t think things through and half the fun in the game is dealing with the consequences! So, go ahead and have your tiny kobold roll ***Threaten*** to tell that big, bad knight that he’ll rip his tongue out!

## Action Rolls

When you attempt to do something challenging in a situation with risk and tension, you make an **action roll** to see how it turns out. Action rolls are a risk made in tense situations with something on the line. If there’s no risk, there’s no reason to roll. You can narrate what happens and move on.

As an action is narrated after the roll, the GM and player collaborate to describe what happens on-screen. Your character’s actions are in your hands and it’s up to you to describe what success looks like. The GM cuts in with NPC reactions, pulls your narration back when it stretches a little too far, or hands out consequences.

An action roll has two functions. It tells you what the PC is trying to do, but also determines the actions of NPCs and the world as the PC is acting. To fully understand the stakes in play and what might happen, each action roll has four parts that are detailed prior to the roll: **intention**, **action**, **position**, and **effect**.

[context]: # (rules summary)

> #### Action Rolls
> You detail your intention and choose an action, the GM details the position and effect, then you roll a number of dice equal to the chosen action's rating to determine how things went.  
**Failure**: You fail to accomplish your goal and suffer a consequence.  
**Mixed**: You manage to do it, but you also suffer a consequence.  
**Success**: You do it well, avoiding any consequences.  
**Critical**: Also, you get increased effect or a secondary bonus!

[context]: # (important rule)

> #### Action Roll (Process)
> Since so much is built into this one roll, you use the following process to fully establish what’s at stake before the player decides whether to roll or not. After a few times, everyone in the game gets used to it and it flows naturally in play.  
> 1. **The player details their intention**, or what they want to accomplish.
> 2. **The player chooses an action**, which describes how they approach it.
> 3. **The GM okays the roll or modifies position and effect** by considering the intention and action within the context of the story.
> 4. **The player rolls or chooses another approach.** If the position and effect are not agreeable, players are free to back off and try something different.

The roll’s <ins>effect</ins> determines how well you accomplish the intention and the roll’s <ins>position</ins> determines how bad the consequences are on a mixed or failure. <ins>Consequences</ins> complicate the situation as NPCs and the world move against you.

Action rolls are assumed to have a chance at achieving what we’d expect as “normal” results for the chosen action, but also carry the risk of something that complicates the situation. This is the default position and effect for rolls and is not explicitly stated. However, when circumstances are outside the norm, the GM can modify the <ins>position and effect</ins> (detailed later) of a roll. Depending on the situation, you might end up in a <ins>dominant</ins> or <ins>dire</ins> position, or with <ins>strong</ins> or <ins>weak</ins> effect.

[context]: # (example of play)

> **Brak**: “I want to break his sword, so I'm going to do a running leap and ***Smash*** down on it."  
**GM**: “I think this is going to be <ins>dire</ins>. You're on a roof and this guy is a competent swordsman. Let's see that roll.

**It’s the player’s responsibility to narrate their character’s success***. Since your intention is clear and the stakes and possible effectiveness for the roll are laid out prior to rolling dice, you have a good idea of how far your action can carry. Once the roll is made, you describe what your character does.

**It’s the GM’s responsibility to narrate for NPCs, judge the results, and hand out consequences**. They can step in and modify the player’s narration when needed, either reining it in when the player goes too far, describing NPC actions during it, or encouraging the player to expand on what they’ve described.

**In this way, players and GMs narrate the results of action rolls together**. The GM should try to give the players room to narrate, then cut in with NPC actions or adjusting the scope of the action the PC is describing. Each GM handles this a little differently, but the goal here is to get players to describe as much of their PC’s actions as they can on their own. The fiction flows best when players are descriptive.

### The Scope of Rolls

Action rolls resolve several things happening within the fiction at the same time. It covers the setup of the action, its execution, and the fallout as well as anything else that might be taking place on-screen while that happens. **The world moves every time an action roll is made**. This can change the dynamic of the scene or have unintended side effects separate from what the PC was trying to accomplish.

The scope of what you can accomplish is determined by your intention, the chosen actions, and the difficulty of anything in your way. How far actions extend is up to the GM, but it’s like a short sequence of shots in a movie. Leaping across a
courtyard, over a wall, and plunging your spear into someone's heart will probably only be one action roll unless each of those things presents a unique challenge with interesting consequences. More complex intentions can be cut up into several actions or represented with a <ins>progress clock</ins>. The more difficult something is to accomplish, the more likely it is to be broken up in this way.

### Smooth Narration

Most things that take place in the game occur due to action rolls and getting the narration for this right makes the system and fiction flow smoothly. It’s nice to think about it as a movie camera controlled by a director (the GM) who gives their actors (the PCs) a lot of leeway in ad-libbing and going off-script.

#### Narrating a Success or a Critical

**On a success**, the focus is solely on the PC. The world is moving around you, out of focus, in the background, or off-screen but the camera stays right where you want it. You accomplish what you set out to do without any setbacks. **A success feels clean.**  
Describe your action, keeping the scope of actions and the position and effect of the roll in mind. It’s the GM’s job to help guide this narration and make sure it matches up with the roll’s position and effect. They might have to pull it back a little if you get overzealous, or tell you when your action carries further than you narrated.

**On a critical**, you steal the show. You have total control of the camera and your action goes better than you could have hoped for. This might manifest in increased effect or the action on-screen causing a secondary effect. **A critical feels perfect**.  
The GM is the final judge of the results of the critical, but you have a lot of freedom in describing what you think happens as a result of it, with the GM prompting you to expand on it or coming up with other ideas when you're not sure.

#### Narrating a Mixed

**On a mixed**, the camera is much more dynamic. The focus might start on the PC as you describe your action and, in the end, you do manage to accomplish it. However, things don’t go as well as you hoped and it’s the GM’s job to steal the limelight, pull the camera away from your PC, and hand out consequences. **A mixed feels messy.**  
Narrating it is a bit like improv - you need to open the door for the GM with your
narration. You know consequences are coming, so give the GM hints about what you think might make sense by mentioning some weakness, like how you leave your guard down or forget an important detail. The GM might also begin by telling you
what the consequence is going to be, so it matches up with your narration.

#### Narrating a failure

**On a failure**, things go poorly. The focus might start on the PC, with you narrating how your action starts or where it goes wrong, but the GM soon takes control and describes how the world makes you suffer some consequences. **A failure feels tense.**  
It’s the GM’s job to ramp up the tension and drama, creating more interesting scenes.

> **On a mixed, an action is almost always as successful as rolling a success.**  
Likewise, the consequences are just as bad as rolling a failure. The exception to this is that a mixed only ticks a clock or slashes a heart once, not twice.

### Moving the Spotlight

Scenes are where the action happens and time passes in them sequentially, with actions or GM narration pushing it forward. Often though, multiple PCs are acting at the same
time and the timeline gets a bit messy, requiring you to rewind it a little bit and resolve what happened while another PC was acting. That’s completely normal.

Thinking about this like a movie makes it easy to imagine. When a PC jumps into action, the camera stays on them. Time goes by as they perform an action or a sequence of actions. You’re not limited to only one action - in fact, you’re encouraged to follow through or take the next step if it feels right and creates a cool moment.

If enough time has passed or there’s a dramatic cliffhanger or lull in the action, it’s probably time to pass the torch and allow other PCs to step into the spotlight. This is each player's responsibility. If you feel like you've "done enough for now" or want to "come back to this after action elsewhere," it's a good sign that someone else deserves a turn. The GM can help here, too, by panning over to a nearby PC or cut away to a PC in another location. Then when the timing is right, they can bring the spotlight back to the first PC.

**There is no set turn order**. Scenes play out with the spotlight jumping back and forth to the PC who is doing something at that moment. You can act when:
- **You take the initiative**, grabbing the spotlight and declaring an action.
  - *“Okay, I have something I want to do.”*
  - *"Mind if I cut in here with an action?”*
  - *"I’ll go next. I think I have an idea.”*
- **Another player passes the spotlight**, giving you the chance to shine.
  - *“We need someone to bust down this door. Drak?”*
  - *“I’m gonna go now, which should open the way for Melik after.”*
  - *"Yo Joran, why don’t you stick an arrow in that guy real fast?”*
- **The GM points the camera at you** and asks what you’re doing.
  - *“Hey Messa, you haven’t acted in a while. What are you doing?”*
  - *"Okay, we cut to Grimmy who’s just now getting in place.”*
  - *"We then see the tiny goblin hiding behind the orc. Marv?"*
- **The GM keeps the camera on you** and prompts you to follow through.
  - *“You managed to jump on the griffon’s back - now what?”*
  - *"The shed crumbles into a pile of rubble - what’s next?”*
  - *"Let’s keep the camera on you for a bit, I like where this is going.”*

And when there just seems to be a lull and the table gets quiet, the GM has a few other options to get movement happening.
- **Ask “Who’s next?”** Just prompting players to act is often enough.
- **Compel a PC to act** when their dark impulse overrides their indecision.
- **Inflict consequences** from a powerful NPC. When players experience indecision, sometimes it’s fun to let that manifest as PC indecision as well and a powerful NPC should jump at the opportunity to take advantage of that.

### Sharing the Spotlight

There’s no preset turn order in *Wicked Ones* for an important reason - going in a set order creates unnatural sequences of action which interferes with dramatic pacing. You want to keep the camera on where the action’s at until it hits a nice, interesting spot to cut away from it.

However, this freeform system creates a pretty big problem. There are many types of people out there and some aren’t as likely to take initiative on their own. It could be that they enjoy listening to what other players are doing, they don’t have any good ideas, they can’t find a spot to jump in, they're used to systems with set turn orders, or they’re a quiet person in general. No matter the reason, just knowing that this can be a problem usually goes a long way towards solving it. Keep your fellow players in mind as you're taking the spotlight. Hold onto it while you have good ideas or want to see a short sequence of events through, but help the GM redirect when nobody else seems to be jumping in.

Mechanical limits like stress, shock, or being bloodied tend to push the spotlight away from more active players. This is intentional. So while those PCs may dominate a scene early declaring action after action, that can only last so long. Eventually, they’ll run out of resources and other PCs who are still pretty fresh can step up and carry the scene forward.

As a player, if you’re setting up a cool scene, open the door for other players to walk through it. Ask them directly, “When I’m doing this, what’s Gorlak doing?” or even call out their name in-character, “Hey Gorlak, get in here and check this out!” Just letting everyone else at the table know that you're interested in having their characters in your scenes makes it easier for them to jump in.

The important thing to keep in mind is that you’re all sitting down at the table to tell cool stories together and have a good time doing so. Participation in the story is an important part of that, so work together as a group to make sure that every player gets their fair share of the spotlight.

> **GM**: "You knock him off the wall but lose sight as he falls backwards. You hear a thud and an "oof" as he lands hard on the other side."  
**Ulrot**: "Okay, I want to climb up the wall and then jump on him."  
**GM**: "There's not a lot standing in your way, so I think you can get up the wall without a roll. Once there, you see him lying on the ground. You still planning to jump on him?"  
**Ulrot**: "You bet..." (grabs dice)  
**GM**: "Great, but hold that thought. The focus has kinda been on you for a while here, so let's just say we cut away right as you leap."  
**GM**: (turns to the other players) "You all see him disappear over the wall. Crag, you've been quiet for a while - what are you up to?"
