# Chapter 1 - The Basics

> “That was quick. In and out, just like we planned. Look at 'em, up there, wondering where the hell we went. So how much ya think they're gonna pay for this princess anyway? Huh Spaz? Uh... Spaz? Why you got that murder look in your eyes again?"

&mdash; Brok, Orc Brute

## Getting Started

You play as monsters working together to build a dungeon and wreak havoc on the region around it. The dungeon is the main character of the story you're telling. It’s your home and refuge, a safe place to lay your head after some raiding and the only thing between you and the end of an adventurer’s sword. The dungeon grows over time and you fill it with all kinds of crazy stories, like fending off adventurers, busting the heads of your minions, or dragging in prisoners to torture. You play not only your own character, but also the minions and creatures that inhabit your dungeon, as well as all the traps, tricks, locks, and magic rituals you fill it with.

This chapter covers the basic game mechanics and how the characters work, while later chapters cover how the dungeon works in more detail. Newly introduced or important game terms and rules are in **bold** to call attention to them. New terms that are explained later in the book are <ins>underlined like this</ins>. Some terms such as actions, attributes, calling abilities, and dungeon rooms are displayed in ***This font***.

### Phases & Scenes

Gameplay follows a <ins>**cycle of play**</ins>. While <ins>lurking</ins>, you build up your dungeon and deal with any <ins>calamity</ins>. While <ins>raiding</ins>, you leave the dungeon and attack targets on the surface, then deal with any <ins>blowback</ins> it causes. A lot happens within each phase and for the most part, time passes fluidly. You can montage some action or skip around in time with PCs doing things at different times and places.

When things heat up and the action gets interesting, you zoom in to what's called a **scene**. Within scenes, time slows down and events progress in sequential order. You can still skip forward when nothing interesting is happening, but time is mostly driven forward by player action. When the starting situation in a scene isn’t exactly clear, you use engagement to clarify it. When the excitement wraps up, you zoom back out into the more fluid flow of time again. This zooming in and out happens naturally through play and doesn’t always have to be clearly stated.

**“Let’s make this a scene,”** **“I wanna see how this plays out,”** or **“What does that look like?”** are useful phrases for those times when you or the GM want to cut in and set up a scene. When this occurs, the player starting the scene or the GM sets the scene up, detailing where your characters are and describing what’s happening around you. You then zoom in and take on the roles of your characters. When other players go out of their way to join dungeon scenes, they <ins>earn xp</ins> for doing so.

You use scenes to flesh out the story and establish elements of the fiction. Sometimes a brief description and then using a game mechanic allows you to add some detail to the story without playing out the entire scene, but when you do zoom in, it gives you the chance to make that scene an important part of the story.

> “I’m going to recruit some goblins from that village as minions. Of course, I’m going to pay a gold to do it but I want to zoom in here and make it a scene to see what our relationship with these goblins is like. I strut straight into their village. I think a bunch come scurrying out as they notice me, so I pull out some gold and ***Banter***, ‘Who needs a job?’”

### Fiction-First Gaming

Throughout this book, you’ll find various mechanics for how to judge in-game situations. One thing should be made clear, though &ndash; these mechanics exist to be used after the fiction has been established.

When you play a roleplaying game, you first imagine the fictional situations that your characters are in. You declare how they act and then work backwards from that to match up what’s happening “on-screen” with a game mechanic that feels right to determine how it plays out.

> **Rule of Description**: You can’t access game mechanics before giving at least some level of description. Even a simple one-line explanation suffices.

> “I head down to that goblin village I went to a few weeks ago and talk to some of their young warriors, convincing them to join us. I’ll pay a gold to recruit them as minions.”

**You do this because every detail you can add into the fictional world helps make it more interesting.** You never know when these details might matter down the road. The core mechanics of *Wicked Ones* support elements of the fiction impacting gameplay. Actions are flexible and easy to apply to various situations, while position 
and effect give mechanical weight to narrative elements within the fiction. However, when you can’t find mechanics that match up with what’s happening, the game collapses neatly down into a single <ins>fortune roll</ins>. You can always fall back on this when you’re not sure what to do or can't recall a particular rule. Just make a fortune roll, narrate what happens, and move on.

### Play Structure

While the game works well as a one-shot or even a short length campaign, an ideal campaign of *Wicked Ones* covers about 16 sessions, which is 4 months of weekly 3-5 hour sessions. You can expect a dungeon invasion about every third or fourth session and your dungeon to increase in tier at the same rate. As your dungeon approaches tier 4, you get closer to realizing your master plan and the region around the dungeon becomes more likely to unite against you.

Throughout these sessions, your PC and minions act as your primary roleplaying tools. You can step into either role whenever you think it would be interesting to do so.

Minions are groups of monsters who live in your dungeon for pay. They are like secondary PCs and the more you make them a part of the story, the larger your dungeon will feel. Each Wicked One has control of enough hoard to recruit a pack of minions, though this doesn’t mean the minions are blindly loyal to their master. They have their own impulses and ideas, so put in the effort to make them into their own independent characters.

## Flow of Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important. While the GM and the players work together to establish the sandbox and factions within it, the world mostly resides in the mind of the GM. The GM has two responsibilities in this regard:
- **Share information about the setting with the players** so they can make informed decisions to weave a fun and interesting story.
- **Describe what a character perceives, suspects, or intuits** so the players can understand how they can interact with the environment.

Unfortunately, there’s too much going on to tell the players everything. It would take forever and be boring. So, when information is lacking, it’s up to the players to ask for what they want to know.

> Simply ask the GM a question about the world when you want to learn something. Anything known by normal people living in an area should be told to the players. Everything else is **hidden information**.

[comment]: # (the paragraph above is not a quote but player information)

Most information about the world should be known by everyone at the table, but certain information is hidden from players. This might be weaknesses in a defense or secrets the PCs can exploit. This depends on how well known the information is, though. The GM might tell the players about a huge hole in a castle wall, but detailed information about corrupt guards might be hidden. They could also reveal an open secret about a local priest, such as a gambling addiction, but shouldn't let the players know about a secret lover. Obscuring information in this way increases the challenge, protects NPC motives, and creates dramatic tension. It's the GM's job to find the right balance between what information is freely available and what needs to be gained through the methods over the next few pages.

**You can act on any knowledge you have, even if your character doesn't know it.** While monsters have extremely limited knowledge of the overworld, that doesn’t mean that players do. Choosing raid targets or finding some trouble to get up to is more fun when everyone is in the know. It’s all about making choices that are fun to play through. Monsters have an uncanny knack for showing up at the worst times and places. They prey on weakness in civilization, almost like they have a sense for it. You can use this to justify acting on knowledge that the players have but the characters don't.

> "So I remember deciding when we set up the sandbox that this human encampment is on the brink of starvation. I think what I'm gonna do is go hunt down a deer and hang it from a tree like I'm skinning it. That'll lure in a couple of them for sure."

### Establishing Facts

**While the GM is the main author of the world, the players are also contributors.** You can try to establish facts within the fiction just by asking the GM a question. You might ask something like “Hey, can there be a big hole on the other side of that wall?” Then the GM needs to make a judgement call:
- **YES**: : If it seems likely or they just want to see what you’ll do, they can simply say yes. Players are very likely to interact with details they bring into the game.
- **NO**: If they don’t think it’s plausible or even if they just don’t want whatever it is to exist, they can say no. That’s well within their scope as the GM.
- **MAYBE**: If they want to leave it up to the dice, they can make a <ins>fortune roll</ins> to determine whether something is true or not.

> The GM must say yes when facts are established by <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins> except when it's highly implausible.

[comment]: # (the paragraph above is not a quote but player information)

When players ask vague questions about the world, it's often because they already have something in mind that they'd like to see in the story. This is a good opportunity for the GM to push players to establish facts by responding with a leading question like “What are you hoping to find?” or “What do you think is along that road?” Of course, if they don't have anything in mind, the GM can describe the world instead.

The players are a nice resource for the GM to tap into to help flesh out the world with details they're interested in interacting with. When describing the world, the GM can always prompt players to establish facts. When they do so, the likelihood of them bringing those details into the game later drastically increases. This also helps ease the creative burden on the GM. When all's said and done, though, it's the GM's job to tie all this creativity together into a cohesive world.

> **Grok**: “Hey, what’s along this road? Maybe some farms or something?”  
**GM**: “Sure... that seems likely. I think there’s probably several small farms around here. Did you have anything specific in mind?"  
**Grok**: "Yeah, I was thinking that there could maybe be a larger, fancier plantation towards the center here. Raiding farms usually isn't worth it since farmers are so tough and not really rich, but maybe there's a place here with quite a bit more loot than what a farm would have."  
**GM**: "That's cool. I really like that. Sounds like you're honing in on a raid target here. Want me to sketch a quick map?"  
**Grok**: "Yeah, if you don't mind. I'm thinking stealth or maybe an assault for the raid plan, but I wanna see that map first."

### Hidden Information

**Scouting the surface is incredibly dangerous for monsters** and if caught, you're probably not going to make it back to the dungeon. If you don't have the proper training (a <ins>calling ability</ins>), your lack of understanding of how civilization works means it's unlikely that you'll learn more than common knowledge. So even when you see something, it's difficult to put it into context and make use of that info.

You spend most of your time lurking behind your dungeon defenses, making it tough to learn about the surface. You have to rely on the following methods to get your hands on hidden information:
- **<ins>Torture</ins> prisoners** to break them and learn their secrets.
- **<ins>Contact</ins> factions or vile friends** and convince them to help.
- **<ins>Pay gold</ins>** to someone you know, such as a vile friend or allied faction.
- **<ins>Raid</ins>** a target and steal information they don't want known, using safety in numbers to traverse the surface.
- **Use <ins>calling abilities</ins> or <ins>dungeon rooms</ins>**, which allow you to establish facts within a limited scope. This guarantees that you have useful information.
- **<ins>Flashback</ins>** to using information gathering calling abilities and dungeon rooms or paying gold when you need information most. A torture chamber also allows you to flashback to torturing prisoners.

When you successfully use one of the above methods to gain some hidden information, it is revealed with one of the following (GM's choice):
- **Ask Questions**: The player can ask a question or two that the GM answers if the information can be gained from that source.
- **Establish Facts**: The player establishes a fact or two about the world.
- **Reveal Secrets**: The GM reveals a piece or two of useful information.

> **Zella**: “I'm going to use my scout ability here to establish a fact about this trading post. I've been watching this road for months and I know at the beginning of each month, a big shipment of wine comes into the region. We need drinks for our dungeon's tavern.”  
**GM**: “You know, that's not all that hidden. We can just establish that that's true. I could reveal a secret about it or maybe you have an idea?"  
**Zella**: “Hmm, I'm not coming up with anything. What do you have?"  
**GM**: “Let's say that a few bottles of this wine are special. They're intended for the abbey for use in their ceremonies. Without it, the power of their god will wane in this region until the next shipment."
