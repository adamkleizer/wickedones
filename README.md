# Markdown specifics

- Comments are added to the markdown with the following notation:  
`[comment]: # (free text)`

- Textboxes and styled paragraphs from the book are added using blockquotes, the purpose of the styling (as conceived by the markdown creator) is marked with the following notation:  
`[context]: # (purpose)`  
These contexts are directly preceding the blockquotes affected. The blockquotes that are in a single enclosure semantically (and visually in the book) and thus affected by the notation are following each other without empty lines in-between.  
Blockquotes without a context are indeed quotes in the book, without any further distinction in meaning.  
The following is a list of possible contexts to be found throughout the book:
  - `[context]: # (chances)`
  - `[context]: # (example of play)`
  - `[context]: # (important rule)`
  - `[context]: # (list of examples)`
  - `[context]: # (roll summary)`
  - `[context]: # (table footnote)`
  - `[context]: # (tips)`
