# Gamemaster

> "Monstrous scum, raiding and pillaging our lands. Now they'll get what they deserve. Follow close! Let none of them leave these foul tunnels alive. And worry not, for there'll be reward enough for all of us when we get to their hoard."

&mdash; Sir Bastion Tell, Knight

## The GM's Job

As the gamemaster, you're the one that ties the game together. Within the story, your job is to represent the world and the NPCs that inhabit it. You run a simulation of what happens as the PCs wreak havoc in the sandbox, determine how the world responds to them, and present them with interesting and fun challenges to overcome.

Outside of the story, a lot of the responsibility for keeping gameplay flowing and preparing for the game between sessions will fall on you. Sharing as much of this responsibility as you can with everyone at the table is best - you're all co-authors of the game, after all. However, group activities tend to need someone to act as a leader to keep things moving and more often than not, that will be your job.

The following pages outline several tenets to follow when gamemastering. Consider them as advice or guidelines rather than rules, as each gamemaster will have a different style. Choose the ones that work best for you. Before beginning this section, though, you should review the **<ins>GM's Best Practices</ins>** to put yourself in the right frame of mind. You should also internalize how the **<ins>Flow of Information</ins>** works in *Wicked Ones*.

### Represent the World Honestly

**Be the sandbox.** You and the players are making a story together and as you add pieces of information to this fiction, it's up to you to run the simulation of how the world responds within your own mind. As you consider how factions respond with blowback, how the dungeon suffers calamity, or what circumstances are important to position and effect, strive to represent the world honestly and build trust from your players that you're making reasonable calls.

**Don't set out with an agenda**, pushing for certain events to come to pass. Let the players knock over the dominoes in the sandbox and watch as they fall. This is their story, so let them drive it and play to find out how the story unfolds.

**Strive to change the dynamic** of a situation when handing out consequences, making subsequent rolls more interesting than the last. Use them to push the story forward, rather than getting stuck in a loop with little progress.

**Give out consequences that make sense.** Make sure that consequences flow from the fiction, feeling realistic given a situation. Nothing is worse from a player perspective than a consequence not making sense given what just happened. When you do need to make some action happen off-screen or with little connection to the current action roll, explain what is going on.

**Don't take away easy wins** just because the players are rolling well or had a great plan. Reward that! GMs have a tendency to want to introduce an "appropriate" amount of challenge and when PCs breeze through a raid or dungeon defense, it might feel a little hollow from the GM's perspective. As long as you're being honest about the world and the challenges represented within it, these easy wins aren't likely to happen all that often so when they do, let them enjoy it!

### Keep the Dungeon in Focus

**Make the game about building a dungeon.** Help the players feel that the dungeon is the center of the story. Players will have a tendency to focus on their own individual PCs, so asking them questions about why they're in the dungeon, what they think about its progress, what they want to change, and how they feel about the master plan helps reinforce the dungeon as the center of the story. Try to relate their actions back towards the dungeon in some way. The more you take time to discuss these things, the more important the dungeon feels and the easier it becomes to make a master plan that focuses on the dungeon as a whole.

**Push for scenes within the dungeon**, zooming in and expanding on player action there. Breeze by minor stuff outside of the dungeon, but try not to miss a moment where you can add a bit more detail within it.

**Set faction goals that matter for the dungeon.** Each faction will have a myriad of things they want to accomplish, but the majority of them likely have no relation to the dungeon itself. Anything that doesn't change the dynamic in meaningful ways can just be backgrounded. If it ever suddenly becomes important, you can always simulate a few faction rolls to see their progress towards something.

**Don't fall in love with the sandbox.** Even though you're controlling it and representing it honestly, the game is always about the dungeon. Don't outshine what the PCs have going on with their dungeon by amazing events done by the factions. The factions and their goals are backdrops to give the PCs' story depth.

### Give Players Interesting Choices

**Keep dark impulses in mind**, and use them to throw a wrench into whatever plans the PCs are making. Strike a nice balance between pressuring these impulses and giving the players some room to breathe. Going for once a session per PC is nice, though don't force them either. Sometimes, a PC will give you plenty of opportunities to compel their dark impulses so multiple times per session is fine if it feels right.

**Always be on the lookout for temptation.** Offer dark bargains when they can't easily afford one, the scene seems static, or a character seems especially vulnerable to temptation. Let those temptations lurk in the back of their minds.

**Give players space to make choices**, but jump in when they seem at an impasse. Choosing what room to build, what downtime action to perform, what raid to go on, and so on can be quite difficult. Sometimes players just need a bit to think about it. Give them space, but recognize when it's heading towards a dead end. Jump in with suggestions or ask them leading questions. If there are a few options out there, initiating a power struggle can help resolve it and makes for a great scene.

**Fall back on player creativity.** Gamemastering *Wicked Ones* can be quite taxing creatively. You don't roll for enemies, but position and effect and consequences mean that you're always processing things in your mind and needing to think on your feet. When you hit a wall, ask your players for help!

### Make the World Dangerous

**Make sure <ins>dire</ins> means <ins>dire</ins>.** Don't pull your punches handing out consequences. The people they're raiding want nothing more than to rid the world of monsters, or at the very least get as far away from them as possible. Be honest about position and fight the urge to tone down consequences, remembering that they can be resisted.

**Announce big consequences before the roll.** Position and effect do a good job of setting the stakes, but for the biggest consequences, let everyone know exactly how it'll play out before the dice are rolled. The tension will go through the roof and it also takes the burden of "hitting them too hard" off of you as they totally know and have accepted the stakes. If you struggle with pulling your punches too often, announcing your consequences more often can help with it.

**Make sure the PCs know that everyone hates monsters.** Dungeons exist for this specific reason, to give these monsters a safe place to hide while doing nefarious deeds. Even monstrous factions are unlikely to get along well with other monsters.

**Make adventurers smart and terrifying.** Think about adventurers as if they were PCs in a hero-based fantasy game. Play them as smart as you'd play your own PC in a game like that. They absolutely want to destroy the monsters, whether their motivation is ridding the world of evil or filling their pockets with treasure.

**Telegraph danger before it hits.** Give the PCs clues as to what might happen if they fail or try to raid a certain area. Let them know that danger lurks. And when they falter after ignoring the clues or accepting the risks, hit them hard.

**Blindside the PCs.** If you have pocketed blowback or calamity, that's enough warning for them. Hit them out of nowhere to reinforce how dangerous the world is. Even without it, adventurers have a really pesky habit of showing up at the most inopportune times. They're likely to appear anywhere in any scene without needing much justification at all for it because that's just what adventurers do.

**Inflict consequences to create immediate action** in a scene that has stalled, or to get a fast paced scene started. This is the GM's greatest power. The world is not only responsive to PC actions. If you feel like an earthquake would make things more interesting, make it happen and see what the PCs do.

**Stand in the PCs' way.** Be honest about the world, but areas that have something worth raiding are always difficult to raid. Any target that they would consider worth hitting either has defenses protecting its approach, ways to make the loot hard to get, or a strong responsive defense to run down raiders.

**Choose blowback and calamity wisely** to make the world feel smart, active, and dangerous. Strike a nice balance between choosing when to invade to pressure their dungeon defenses and act as an existential threat, changing the dynamic with factions, or hitting the PCs themselves. And when in doubt, just pocket it and blindside them with it later at the perfect moment.

### Keep Information Flowing

**Convey lots of detail**, giving the players the information they need to make good decisions. Remember that most of the simulation is happening in your mind and while they can likely make assumptions about what's going on, things are not always as clear for players as it is for you. So give them a lot of information and they can then pick up on these details and play into them to help with position and effect.

**Give seemingly minor details to make scenes come to life.** Let them know an acrid smoke hangs in the air, a lava flow gives off a deep rumbling and crackling, or the sounds of festival and laughter drift across the fields as they launch their raid. Consider what they see, hear, smell, and even taste. Think about the weather and the time of day. Try to make time at the beginning of each scene to add a detail or two because every detail you give to them, they can put to use in their own narration.

**Keep the world moving.** The world will begin to feel like it only responds to what the PCs are doing if you only describe their actions and their consequences. Remember that other things in the world are happening in the background as well and inform the players about them. These could present new interesting opportunities or signal upcoming danger, even when the PCs were successful. If anything, though, more information helps paint a vivid scene and make the world feel alive and real.

**Give NPCs a feature or two that makes them memorable.** Reserve names for the most important of characters. When in doubt, describe them as an adjective and a noun - the fat elf, the surly human, the mysterious sylph. Expand a bit to add importance to the character. Features help reinforce the existence of NPCs in the players' minds. The long-nosed troll with a deep voice, the green hag that smells of burnt wood, or the barrel-chested captain that can barely balance on his horse create instantly memorable characters. And when they matter, give them a name.

**Be curious about the PCs.** Learn about their intentions or what they think is going on. Ask them why they're doing certain things or what they plan on doing next. You're all entertaining each other, but the GM is really the captivated audience for each PC. It's your job to know all about them and what they have going on. This is also a great way of drawing out some of the quieter players.

**Give the players narrative control.** Ask them what they think a faction might do, or what a good consequence in a given situation might be. This is a nice break for you as the GM, but it also keeps the story flowing in interesting ways that might even surprise you and pull the players into the game further. This kind of open discussion fosters a spirit of co-authorship to the story. Also, don't be afraid to say no, or to change up what they want to have happen a little bit to fit better. Ultimately, the responsibility to keep the sandbox making sense is up to you.

**Describe the shifting narrative after every roll.** Even when a PC rolls a success and goes into great detail about what they're doing, take a second afterward to describe what other things have shifted in the world during that time. Each action a PC takes has an opportunity cost. The world is still real and should react to what the PCs are doing. This might even create surprising unintended positive or negative side effects which could create new openings or shut off certain doors.

### Be a Good Director of the Action

**Keep the game moving.** Players will get stuck on what to do next, spin off into out-of-game conversations, get distracted, or tail off into long in-game conversations about something that nobody's really interested in. Just asking a question is usually enough to pull people back into the game, like "Where's your character during all of this?"

**Move the camera between PCs.** When some action sparks up around a PC, focus on them and give them lots of room to accomplish something. Sometimes they will chain a few actions together creating their own mini-scene. Let it play out, but when it starts to get too long, put a pin in it and pan the camera over to someone else in the scene or cut away to a PC in another location.

**Bring quieter players into focus.** No matter what atmosphere you have at the table, some players just aren't comfortable grabbing the spotlight. It's your job to make room for them, creating empty space that's easy to fill or asking them directly what their PC is doing.

**Zoom in on what's interesting and zoom out on what's not.** Time flows pretty fluidly through the phases and not everything needs a scene. Mechanics can't be accessed without some level of description by players, but it could just be a simple line or two. When something seems interesting to see play out, though, zoom right in on it. Bring the players into the moment, set the stage, and ask them what their PCs are doing.

**Ask for details about PC actions.** It's the player's job to narrate what their PC is doing so when they don't, ask some questions. "What does that look like?" is always a good go-to in this case, but an even more detailed question like "So is he losing a limb here or something?" can work well.

**Don't steal a player's thunder.** When their PC does something, make sure not to offer up detailed suggestions about what it looks like. A question like "Do you chop his arm off and it goes flying across the room?" is pretty hard for the player to walk back if they had something else in mind. As soon as you give a detailed suggestion, players begin to imagine it and it starts to feel real. Let the players have their awesome moments.

**Make sure the PCs are the stars of the show.** There can be badass NPCs, both friends and foes, but they're supporting cast. The entire reason this sandbox exists is to let the monsters shine as they burn it down.

**Initiate power struggles.** When you see indecision amongst your players, power struggles create great monstery scenes. They even work for quite minor things and small disagreements. Arguing about nothing important at all is incredibly monstery.

### Use Dungeon Invasions Effectively

**Time your invasions well.** It's ultimately up to the GM to decide when invasions occur. This is intentional, as it gives you a lot of control to balance out the action happening in the game. Multiple invasions in a row might grow a bit tedious, just as having no invasions over an extended period of time is pretty boring.

**Consider how long invasions take.** Sometimes, an invasion might not match up well with the amount of time left in a session. If calamity or blowback are rolled at the end, it's easy to pick it up in the next game with an invasion. But if major blowback is rolled and you've got about 30 minutes left and were expecting to finish downtime and call the game there, maybe hit them with some different blowback or pocket the blowback and start off the next session with the invasion. Pocketed invasions are especially powerful - place a visual reminder, a token or some such, in front of you to let the players know that it's coming.

**Use invasions to provide an existential threat.** The goal of most adventuring parties that enter the dungeon is to wipe out its denizens. Punish the PCs for bad dungeon design or overreaching in their raids. Don't be afraid to end the game with a defeated dungeon. That's the entire point of the game! If that threat is off the table, the reason for building the dungeon disappears. Make sure the players know you're coming to kill their PCs.

**Mix up the goal of invasions.** An adventuring party that enters to rescue a prisoner or steal a specific item can be an interesting change of pace. The PCs are sure to be surprised as some imps enter their sanctum to announce that the prisoners have been freed and the adventurers are getting away. Ask them how they respond and grab some dice, ready to jump into a scene.

**Remember that the players play the dungeon.** An invasion is the players' chance to see all of the stuff they've been building in motion. Give them plenty of narrative control over how this plays out, even as the dungeon defenses fail. Use invasions to give the dungeon its spotlight through the players' descriptions.

**Invade when it makes sense or seems fun.** The world is moving in the background, outside of calamity and blowback. An invasion can happen at any time, for any reason. Random adventuring parties wander the world looking for tunnels to dive into in search of treasure. You never need a reason to invade.

**Play adventurers honestly.** They're experts at dungeoneering. Reward the players when they build clever defenses, but eventually an adventurer will arrive that can bypass these measures. The longer the dungeon exists, the more likely adventurers are to know about the insides of it through rumor or experience.

### Be a Fair Arbiter of the Rules

**Map the fiction back to the rules.** Nobody at the table is likely to know the game as well as you do, so while the responsibility to know the rules rests on everyone, you're in the best position to adjudicate them. When things aren't clear, help players figure out the rule behind what they're trying to accomplish.

**Create a fiction-first atmosphere.** This goes along with the above, but the fiction comes before the rules. The rules exist just to figure out exactly how something plays out when a PC does something uncertain. Help get your players into this mindset as well, encouraging them to describe what their PCs are doing, not what rules they're using. Guide them towards making decisions that their PC would make, not what's mechanically best in a certain situation.

**Trust your gut.** So many decisions in the game rest on your *gut feeling*. You can't process everything going on all the time and don't have to. Most of the time, you'll know things like position and effect or the right consequence because it feels right. This *gut feeling* takes a while to develop, so don't worry too much if you struggle over the first session or two.

**Encourage discussion about rulings.** Many decisions rely on that *gut feeling*, so you might miss out on some details. Be open to players questioning your decisions. You always make the final call, but having the players' trust that you're judging things fairly is important for everyone having a good time. Try to keep these conversations brief, though, as it's just stealing time away from what's really fun in the game.

**Make up rules on the fly.** You're going to find gaps in the rules, weird edge cases, or something the designers never thought of. Don't be afraid to make up a rule or apply other rules more broadly when this happens. When in doubt, everything in the entire game can collapse back down to a fortune roll to see what happens.

**Look rules up later.** There are going to be times when you've forgotten a rule or can't find it in the book. First, be honest about that. Say you don't remember and, if it's fine with everyone, just make up a quick rule, move on, then look it up later.

**Understand the math.** It's a good idea to get a general sense of the probabilities of dice rolls so you know how often things are likely to happen. Mixed rolls are very common and criticals are relatively rare without stacking a lot of +1d bonus dice. Knowing this can help you with pacing and developing your *gut feeling*.

| Pool size | Failure | Mixed | Success | Critical |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0d | 75% | 22% | 3% | 0% |
| 1d | 50% | 33% | 17% | 0% |
| 2d | 25% | 44% | 28% | 3% |
| 3d | 13% | 45% | 35% | 7% |
| 4d | 6% | 42% | 39% | 13% |
| 5d | 3% | 37% | 40% | 20% |
| 6d | 2% | 32% | 40% | 26% |

## Starting a Campaign

The first step of getting a *Wicked Ones* campaign set up is pitching the game to some friends. Here's an example of what that might look like:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Wicked Ones is kind of like Dungeon Keeper meets Blades in the Dark. You play as monsters that build a dungeon together. You raid the overworld for loot to build up your hoard, fend off adventurers invading the dungeon, and try to accomplish a nefarious master plan. It's basically a game about being the bad guys.
>
> You pick a sandbox map of a local region and work together to set up a bunch of factions within it. Then you play to find out what happens to all of it. There's no storyline or anything. It's mostly just introducing the chaos of a dungeon into the middle of some region to see what happens.
>
> Everyone draws the dungeon together on a sheet of paper. It grows over time as you build all kinds of traps, tricks, locks, and rooms inside it and recruit creatures and minions. You also discover other crazy stuff underground as your dungeon grows."

Now that you have some people on board and ready to get together to play, you have some decisions to make. Getting a campaign of *Wicked Ones* up and running requires some setup. The flow lined out in this section should help make that setup go more smoothly. You can follow this guide or just use it as a guideline.

### Session 0

It's best to get everyone together for a proper session zero where you can talk about expectations for the game and make some major decisions together. Making sure everyone has a say in these decisions will help all players buy into the premise of the game. Before play can start, you need to do the following, probably in this order:

- **Choose a sandbox.** The region the dungeon interacts with has a huge impact on the types of stories that will be told. It's best if the PCs are new to the region, without pre-existing connections to it, so the region can be revealed over time through play. This is also the time to choose where the dungeon will be.
- **Choose a dungeon theme.** The dungeon you build really sets the tone for the entire campaign and can change the way you view the sandbox. It puts everyone on the same page about what kind of story you want to tell.
- **Choose callings.** With the above choices made, players have a much stronger idea about what the game will be about and can make characters that fit in well with those choices.
- **Choose safety tools.** This is a game about being evil and it's likely you'll hit some uncomfortable territory, so taking the time to talk about the themes everyone is okay with exploring can head off problems down the road. This is a nice opportunity to set up the x-card, lines and veils, or movie ratings discussed in the intro chapter.

### Session 1

Over the first session, you need to **create your dungeon** and **set up factions** in the sandbox. Both of these are best done after the players have a chance to play their characters a bit so they can understand their group's dynamic a little better and make better choices about the game they want to play. Here's a recommended flow for the first session and most of it's on rails, serving as a kind of tutorial. You can tweak this or come up with your own, but this one will get you started nicely!

**Start the game off.** Gather your group around the table, character sheets filled in and ready to go, then read or paraphrase the following aloud:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "You’re all members of a failed dungeon, one that collapsed in upon itself after your master was overthrown by an adventuring party. The dungeon was ransacked and the remnants of the minions and creatures tore each other apart in the aftermath as they struggled for control.
>
> While you never really knew each other before, in the ensuing chaos and escape from the doomed dungeon, you recognized that each of you had the spark of a Wicked One, a monster that can suppress its dark impulses long enough to work towards a master plan together. Seeing first hand how precarious a dungeon run by just one master can be, you decided to band together and set up a dungeon of your own.
>
> But that was weeks ago. Since then, you've been on the run through civilized territory, looking for the right spot for the dungeon. Now, you're huddled around a dying campfire under a tree as rain pours down around you. You're soaked, cold, tired, and pretty angry. You’ve gone hungry the last several nights. There's one thing you’re certain of, though. These lands around you are full of ripe targets. But first, you're going to need refuge."

**Have the players describe their characters.** Set a small scene, describing the cold and the campfire, then go around and ask each player to describe their PC. Ask some probing questions to get more information out of them.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "What's your name? What do you look like? What trappings and supply do you have? How did you get the dark heart you start with?"

**Set the dungeon atmosphere.** Get some details about the type of dungeon they want to create, which will start to make it feel more real. Read them the following:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "As you sit there together watching the fire slowly die as the wind splashes it with rain, your thoughts turn towards what your future dungeon will be like.
>
> I’m going to ask you all some questions to set the atmosphere of the dungeon you might all build someday. Let's try to answer them in character. Feel free to disagree. Monsters are sure to have strong opinions about where they want to live. We'll resolve any disputes with a power struggle."

Go through the list of dungeon atmosphere questions. When they're stuck, give them a few examples. Try to keep this quick. Push for answers and, when they disagree, initiate power struggles. This is a good chance for everyone to see the dice in action without any consequences and to establish that **it's okay for PCs to argue** because they're monsters! Be sure to write these down on the dungeon sheet.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - What will your dungeon’s entrance look like from the outside?
> - What will the floors and walls of your dungeon be like?
> - What will lighting be like inside your dungeon?
> - What smell will greet those who step foot into your dungeon?
> - What will your hoard consist of?

**Set up a raid.** So now you have a lot of information about what kind of dungeon they want to build. You know where it's at in the sandbox, it's entrance, and it's overall atmosphere. Take a short break here to set up a raid using these ideas.

The players need to find a home and you're going to give it to them soon. They're about to go on a raid to clear out the beginnings of their new dungeon home. Starting from scratch like this builds a great sense that they've earned their home and gives a strong desire to defend it.

A shallow cave with a short tunnel and an empty cavern works best. Think of some good guys that might be hunkered down in that cave. Are they a group of farmers escaping the rain? Maybe it's a few soldiers on patrol from a local guard post? One of the easiest, though is making it a group of dwarven wanderers that have their sights set on the cave as a new home for themselves. As you make plans, if some details aren't quite clear about what they might want their dungeon to look like, ask the players. Get their feedback.

Once you have an idea in mind, read them the following:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Suddenly, the wind picks up and your campfire goes out. You shiver as the conversation dies off. Just then, you barely hear a voice in the distance and the hair on your neck stands on end. It's the Light Tongue, the language of the humans, elves, dwarves, and those of their kind. You can't understand it, but you know it when you hear it and it grates on your nerves.
>
> The voice is a ways away, but you hear it again, followed by unmistakable laughter. They sound at ease, comfortable. People out in the cold don't talk like that. You all look at each other and grin, knowing you're about to get out of the rain."

Now speak directly to the players, out of character.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "We’re about to jump into a raid and bust some heads. This will be the beginning of your dungeon. Don’t worry about knowing all the details, scouting, or things like that - the system is designed to throw you straight into the action and figure out details along the way."
>
> "You need to choose a raid plan. I realize you don’t know much about what’s over there, but you’re a monster and you know you want to get out of the rain. Just roll with it. The plan will tell us basically how you want to approach dealing with them. Take a look at the raid plans on your sheet. Don't overthink it, we'll learn as we go along - which looks good to you?"

Get an answer, using a power struggle if there's a disagreement. Make suggestions if they're unsure, with an assault plan always being a very straightforward choice. Once you have the plan, get some details about it by asking a few questions. Then, grab some dice and roll engagement.

**Throw them into the action.** This is your chance to reinforce that this game skips the leadup and jumps straight into the action. Set the scene for them and use the details they provided to figure out what the first thing they would do is. They'll probably want to try to take care, scout ahead, make intricate plans - **don't let them!**

So let's say they planned an assault and chose the Brute to lead the way. They got a 3d engagement roll since the rain gives them good cover and ended up rolling a success. Maybe you should start them off with the Brute running straight at the entrance to the cave. That might look like this, as soon as engagement is rolled:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "You guys take off at full speed, running towards the voices, weapons in hand. As the cave comes into view, you spot three dwarves sitting around a campfire just inside. They seem to be in pretty good spirits, drinking ale and chatting. They have some large crossbows laying beside them and mining tools around, but are pretty relaxed. Another dwarf is a bit behind them, skinning a deer. Your stomachs growl at the sight of it.
>
> You start with the upper hand here, so let's say they're not even watching the entrance. Brute, you're running straight towards them, battleaxe ready. What do you do?"

This scene is meant to be simple and straightforward to teach the basic mechanics in Wicked Ones. It’s not really challenging unless they roll very badly. A dwarf might take a success or a couple of mixed rolls to take care of (kill, chase away, etc.).

If you want to get a bit more advanced and make the scene more challenging, you can even introduce a hireling or a tier 0 adventurer here. Maybe one of the dwarves is actually a cleric or the one skinning the deer is a ranger? You can introduce some good loot here, too, by maybe having a mule with packs on its back get loose and try running away.

Take this scene slow. Talk through the mechanics. Explain how position and effect work, but also err on the side of keeping it simple. Get everyone used to how the camera pans around without any set turn order. Encourage them to clearly state intention and approach, then narrate their own actions after they roll. When a consequence is handed out, suggest they resist it. New players might forget they can do this. As these basic mechanics settle into their minds, maybe get into more advanced stuff like compelling a dark impulse or starting a clock.

**Wrap up the raid.** The cycle of play for this session essentially started at the beginning of the raid phase. Once the raid winds down, explain how blowback works. Talk about their raid plan and discuss whether they stuck to the plan or not. Then make a blowback roll and if it's major or minor, pocket it and explain what that means. You don't want to deal with blowback yet. Just keep things moving.

**Introduce the Imps.** Read your players the following:

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Comfortable in the cave, you look around and realize this is the perfect place for a dungeon. You wake up early the next morning and get to work, starting to rearrange the cave to your liking. Suddenly, you hear some noise coming from the entrance."

Address the players and explain how this works.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Your dungeon attracts imps, tiny monsters that come to you for protection. In return, they do the busy work around your dungeon. They’re used to push simple tasks into the background and populate the dungeon. You can bring them into scenes, use them to set up traps, and so on. Let's decide what your imps are, what they look like, and give them two traits from the list of imp traits on pg. 187. These help determine what kind of presence they have during scenes."

Once you get a sense for what the imps are like, set up a scene. This breathes some life into your dungeon early on and establishes your imps as a presence within it.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "As you all turn to look at the noise, two or three imps peek around the corner. They see you all beginning to set up the cave. They walk over and grab a rock and start hauling it away for you. Their intentions are clear. How do you all respond?"

**Draw the Dungeon.** At this point, you zoom way out. You go through a montage lasting a few months as your dungeon gets established as play goes best when you jump from having no dungeon to having a small, but fully functional dungeon.

Tell the players that you're going to be drawing out the dungeon now. Explain how the dungeon works best if everyone has a hand in it, but if anyone seems to balk at the idea of drawing, they can ask someone to draw for them. Try to create an open atmosphere that's non-critical of those without a lot of artistic ability. A dungeon doesn't have to be a work of art.

This is a good time to flip back to the dungeon drawing guides, looking over the different drawing styles. The simple style is just lines, letters, and geometric shapes. It can be drawn by anyone. However, you should encourage them to add as much detail as they can as they build their dungeon. The more visual detail there is, the more it will come up within roleplaying scenes.

Turn back to pg. 170 and finish the dungeon creation steps before moving on. You've already finished most of them through this session. As a word of warning, naming the dungeon can be a challenge. Asking each player to offer up one name, then whittling it down to two candidates and power struggling to decide works well!

**Start the normal cycle.** Now that all of that is established, the normal flow of the game can begin. Go ahead and start a full lurking phase here. Do recovery and then make a loot roll, taking +1d for hitting an equal tier target and an additional +1d if they secured the good loot offered up during the raid. Explain how the loot roll works and have everyone make the roll. It's pretty unlikely people will overdo it on this roll, but make sure they describe their revelry.

You then move into downtime. Review the types of projects they can work on and explain how they each have one downtime action. If there is a failure during these downtime actions, be sure to point out that they can risk it and roll again with -position. You should also explain how gold can be spent to accomplish things in place of a downtime action.

During downtime, try to strongly encourage someone to recruit minions, either with a downtime action or by spending gold. Understanding minion mechanics early is a good idea. They haven't established any factions in the area, but you can always suggest a band of wandering monsters they happened across.

Once the lurking phase is over, explain how calamity works and roll it.

**Invade the Dungeon.** Now that their dungeon is set up, testing its defenses and showing players how it works will finish off the mechanics tutorial. The dungeon will probably have some blowback or calamity coming at this point. If it has both, use one of them to start either a major or minor invasion and then resolve the other one as something a bit less direct. If it only has one, use it to start an invasion. If it has neither, congratulate them on how well everything went, then launch an invasion anyway. It's the perfect time to explain how the world is an incredibly dangerous place that wants nothing more than to be rid of monsters.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "About two months have passed as you and your imps worked away
at getting your dungeon set up. Finally settled in and turning your eye towards the outside world, you Wicked Ones are in your sanctum hatching an evil plan. Unfortunately, invaders approach."

This first invasion should be relatively weak. If the previous raid was a bunch of dwarves, perhaps this could be some of their kin arriving and expecting to see the beginnings of a settlement. If you're launching a major invasion, maybe two tier 0 adventurers and one or two hirelings is a good idea. If it's a minor invasion, maybe it's a tier 0 adventurer and two or three hirelings instead.

If they have minions, the dungeon invasion starts off with their starting location roll. Explain the concept of the sanctum and why the Wicked Ones can't leave it during dungeon defense. Some might balk at this idea, but be firm. Stress the importance of having defenses to stand in-between the PCs and the adventurers as any wounds or stress taken here will carry over into the raiding phase.

**Finally, do xp together.** Go around the table and run through the list of xp triggers. It's very likely that they've missed a lot of them and not being able to mark it at this time will be a big encouragement to bring those things into play next time.

### Between Sessions

Between session 1 and session 2, you should try to answer any questions that your players have. There's a lot to take in during that first session and things are still pretty likely to be a bit unclear. You'll surely need to do some reviewing of the rules yourself as well. That's fine, you can all learn as you go.

There's not a lot of preparation that's needed between sessions of *Wicked Ones*. It might be good to ask the players what they're thinking about doing for their next raid so you can get some ideas in your head going into the next session, though. Scenes can play out on maps with minis or using theater of the mind as your group prefers. If they're played out on a map, try to not get too hung up on the preciseness of what's happening. Just use the maps as a reference and way to build a common image of the scene in everyone's mind. If you do prefer having maps, though, knowing what kind of trouble your players want to cause the next session can help you get some ready.

Encouraging your players to discuss raid plans or at the very least come to the game with some ideas of what they want to do during the upcoming phase is a good idea. When players come to the table prepared, the game gets going sooner and the first
hour of play flows way more smoothly.

Also, now that the players know more about the game, they might want to make changes to their characters. Make it clear that they can swap out anything they've chosen before session 2, even as far as choosing an entirely new calling or switching up their dungeon theme. It's hard to make good choices without knowing more about the game. Let them play the type of character they want to play.

Finally, you should try to run the faction simulation on your own between sessions. Occasionally, it's nice to do it as a group and discuss what's happening, but this can eat into valuable gametime if done too often. You can skip this for now, as your players will be setting up factions at the beginning of the next session.

### Session 2

**Establish factions.** Now that your players have seen an entire cycle of play, have their dungeon set up, and know how their group dynamic feels, they're ready to finalize the sandbox they're playing in. Get out the faction sheet and head over to the section on establishing factions on pg. 276.

**Play to find out.** And now you're set. Everything is completely ready to go. Now all there is to do is jump into the regular cycle of play and enjoy finding out what happens to this sandbox your players are going to devastate.

## Adventurers

As a GM, adventurers are your bread and butter. They're powerful foes that dynamically change any scene they enter. They're clever and damn good at what they do. Play them as if they were player characters in a fantasy hero roleplaying game. When they enter a scene, it's like the world is going hard at the PCs. They're the never-ending thorns in the side of dungeon monsters. Make your PCs fear them and they will love it all the more when they finally bring one down.

The scope of an adventurer's power is known to all at the table. When adventurers enter play, the game becomes less about telling a cool story and more about a life and death struggle. When you play an adventurer, imagine that they're a heroic PC in another fantasy roleplaying game. Think about how those PCs act, how clever they are, and how they'll always get through any situation.

Each adventurer has five parts that determine their ability: **class**, **tier**, **hearts**, **moves**, and a **passive**. When they show up, you should usually let your players know what they're up against. The game is more fun when everyone is in the know and it frees the GM up a bit to go all out with the adventurers to try to take the PCs down.

### Class & Tier

Each adventurer has a class, basically acting as a job title such as an assassin, cleric, or scout. It defines their role within an adventuring party and let's both you and the players know what to expect from them in a scene. An adventurer's class determines what kind of things they excel at and what form their passive and moves take. Adventurers also have whatever gear someone of their class might have, which can affect position and effect, such as a knight in plate mail being hard to kill, an alchemist always having a concoction at hand, or a ranger carrying some traps.

Their tier, rated from 0 to 4, compares directly to your dungeon tier to establish how powerful or skilled they are compared to the PCs and their minions. When an adventurer is of higher tier, it's considered an overwhelming circumstance towards position and effect. It also informs how powerful their moves are, which is detailed later in this section.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Adventurers are Powerful Foes
> Remember that adventurers are very dangerous even without their moves. An assassin might spend a move to disappear into the shadows, but they can do the same thing as a consequence for a failed PC roll. Moves just give them permission to do it without having to respond to PC actions. Anything they can do as an offensive move, they can also do as a consequence.

### Hearts

Each adventurer's tenacity, their ability to stick around in a scene, is measured in hearts. When an adventurer has no more hearts remaining, they're knocked out of the scene. When PCs try to actively take out an adventurer, their actions **slash** these hearts. Each heart takes two slashes to finish off with a slash being equivalent to a clock tick. In short, a mixed does one slash, a success does two, and a critical does three. <ins>Strong</ins> effect deals one extra slash and <ins>weak</ins> effect means one less.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Adventurers have a number of hearts equal to their tier + 1.

**Losing all hearts doesn't always mean an adventurer dies!** Losing all of their hearts means their spirit is broken. This may mean they're dead, but it might also make sense to have them be captured, run away, betray their friends, or whatever else works in that situation and seems interesting.

Hearts are slashed when PCs take specific action to take out an adventurer. This often means physically harming them, but could also be demoralizing or confusing them. Not every action is going to slash an adventurer's hearts, though. It's up to the GM to determine when a PC's actions present a significant setback that makes them want to abandon their current cause. Not all challenges with adventurers should be tackled by taking out their hearts, though. Generally, hearts represent an adventurer's willingness to stick around. Things like running away from or chasing them down are better modelled with an action roll or two or a clock.

### Passives

Every adventurer has one thing that they truly excel at called their passive ability, which is usually based on their class. The GM decides what an adventurer's passive is when they introduce them into a scene. The example adventurers later in this chapter have some passives listed for convenience, but adventurers almost always seem to have just the right skills for the job at hand. For example, if the PCs are trying to get away through a forest, that sounds like a perfectly inopportune time for a ranger to show up! That ranger's passive might be:

- Can move through forests as quickly as an open field.
- Can fire a bow much further than normal.
- Is an expert at tracking and considered higher tier when doing so.
- Is accompanied by a wolf, their loyal hunting companion.

Passives tend to give some mechanical advantage or permission to do something unique. **Passives can be set on the fly by the GM**, so even when using the pre-made adventurers listed later in this chapter, you can make up your own passives that better suit the situation and are easier to bring into play.

### Moves

**Each adventurer can make three moves**, allowing them to put the PCs on their back foot or attempt to avoid an aggressive action by the PCs. They can spend a move to make an offensive move or a defensive move. Moves are not predefined and are chosen on the fly by the GM when they need to be used and are based on the adventurer's class. The example adventurers later in this chapter serve to show how moves work, but it's up to you to choose the right tool for the job at that moment.

**Offensive moves** inflict consequences on the PCs. These tend to be aggressive in nature, such as a direct attack, neutralizing someone by pinning them down or casting a spell on them, or dynamic scene changers.

Their effectiveness is determined by how the adventurer's tier compares to the dungeon tier. Adventurers of the same tier are able to inflict *frustrating* or *devastating* consequences, such as making a PC bloodied. A higher tier adventurer can deliver *devastating* consequences to an entire group, like a powerful wizard fireballing the PCs and leaving everyone bloodied. Adventurers two or more tiers over can even deal out *deadly* consequences. Keep in mind that simply injuring PCs is often the least interesting choice, though, and the one they're most likely to resist or have a defense against.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The barbarian charges toward you, jumps high into the air and brings his warhammer crashing down on your shield. It splinters into a dozen pieces and you take shock to ***MUSCLES*** as it sends a shiver up your arm."
>
> "The ranger sticks an arrow in the tree next to you, forcing you into cover. You know he's trained on your position, pinning you down. You're unable to move while he's covering you. If you try, you'll be dead."

**Defensive moves** allow adventurers to try to partially or fully negating something happening to them, usually used in response to PC actions or dungeon defenses. They can also have a minor effect on the fiction, such as them moving into hiding or knocking you back. **Defensive moves can't be used against a critical.**

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Defensive Move Rolls
> You roll a number of dice equal to the adventurer's tier to attempt to resist an undesired situation.
>
> **Failure**: They resist nothing.  
**Mixed**: They partially resist it, reducing it in severity.  
**Success**: They fully resist it.  
**Critical**: Also, they immediately make a free offensive move.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "You managed to lose the cleric, but he's going to spend a defensive move here to cast a divination spell. He got a success, negating your roll. From the heavens, a ray of sunlight fully illuminates your position."

### Traits & Motivations

Sometimes, giving an adventurer a bit more depth can make them stand out and react more realistically within scenes. If you're about to send a couple of adventurers to their deaths against a heavily defended dungeon, it might not be worth the effort to flesh them out, but if you think an adventurer stands a chance of lasting a bit longer, giving them a motivation and a few traits from below or making up your own can make them feel more real. Choose one or two of these positive traits:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Confident
> - Generous
> - Helpful
> - Honest
> - Optimistic
> - Persistent
> - Steady

Then, choose one or two of these negative traits:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Brash
> - Cocky
> - Dishonest
> - Dumb
> - Greedy
> - Impatient
> - Indecisive
> - Stubborn

And finally, figure out why they're out there adventuring. This reason might even be the same for an entire adventuring party. Choose one or two of these motivations:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Challenge
> - Exploration
> - Justice
> - Respect
> - Riches
> - Thrills
> - Vengeance

### Hirelings

Adventurers sometimes use hirelings to pad their numbers while out on a quest. They pay some skilled locals to accompany them, cover their weaknesses, and, when it really comes down to it, serve as fodder. A hireling is like a mini-adventurer, considered a highly skilled member of their profession. **They have 1 heart and can either make 1 move or have a passive.** Below are some example hirelings:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - archer
> - boatman
> - burglar
> - butcher
> - carpenter
> - cartographer
> - chronicler
> - cook
> - driver
> - farmhand
> - fisherman
> - footman
> - footpad
> - forester
> - guard
> - guide
> - inventor
> - linguist
> - locksmith
> - lumberjack
> - mercenary
> - messenger
> - miner
> - pathfinder
> - priest
> - rat catcher
> - rider
> - sailor
> - sawbones
> - scholar
> - scribe
> - singer
> - spelunker
> - swordsman
> - trader
> - trapfinder

### Best Practices

Adventurers are meant to present a very real challenge for PCs. They're to be feared and help give PCs a reason to not roam the surface without caution and to build a dungeon to hide behind. It's easy to over or under use them, and it's also easy to make facing them more of a chore than a fun challenge. To get the most out of adventurers, you should stick to the following list of best practices.

1. **Timing is important.** When they come into scenes is completely up to the GM. You never need a reason for them to show up. That's just what they do. But making sure to balance this against fun gameplay is also important. You don't need one in every session. Trust your *gut feeling* on the timing.
2. **Play them smart.** They have been dungeon delving and monster hunting for a long time. They know what to expect going in and have survived many encounters with monsters. Make sure that they seem competent. Then again, everyone does something stupid sometimes so have them slip up occasionally.
3. **Exploit PC weaknesses.** Their experience means they will identify weakness and go straight for it. If you notice a weakness in a dungeon or a raid plan, using an adventurer to point it out is a great way to get your PCs more serious about their dungeon layout, lack of using minions on raids, and so on.
4. **Vary their moves.** Just doing the same moves in rapid succession is pretty boring. Try to use a few different types of moves, such as a bit of damage, a bit of positioning, and another that changes the dynamic. And don't use all of them at once. Intersperse them naturally throughout a scene.
5. **Don't overdo it.** One or two adventurers during a raid is a handful. Four in an invasion is about right. Step into using them lightly. Get a good feeling for how they feel in play and how powerful they are, then you can know better when to throw them in the way of your PCs.
6. **Run away sometimes.** Don't let the PCs kill every adventurer they see. While a lot of them will fight to the death, believing what they're doing is right, others are likely to run and return later with better information and more allies. A strong adventurer that's hard to pin down makes for a great recurring enemy.

### Dangerous Foes

Enemies are modelled like any other challenge in *Wicked Ones*. Strong enemies are a mix of clocks, circumstances towards position and effect, and inflicted consequences. Adventurers are just a codified version of this, allowing everyone in the game to see what's at stake. It's straightforward and simple, since adventurers tend to be very similar to each other. For other foes, it's part of the GM's job to use all of the mechanics in *Wicked Ones* to represent enemies in fun and challenging ways. To start to get a sense on how to best represent enemies and how tough they should be, start with a baseline: a lightly armed and armored human soldier.

[context]: # (important rule)
> A typical human soldier can be taken out by rolling a success. On a mixed, it might take them out, but the PC takes a consequence. You could give them reduced effect, meaning the soldier is wounded but still up and the PC suffers a lighter consequence.

Now that you have a baseline, you can compare other foes against this. Make changes when an enemy is different than a typical soldier:

- **Attack** is stronger or weaker. Overwhelming circumstance towards position.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - The enormous crab claws can snip an orc in half.
  > - The dryad wields powerful nature magic.
  > - The giant can destroy a small house with its club.

- **Defense** is stronger or weaker. Overwhelming circumstance towards effect.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - The treant takes little damage from blades, but fire is another matter!
  > - The ghost can't be harmed by physical weapons.
  > - The fire elemental is immune to fire, but vulnerable to water.

- **Unique ability**. Inflict consequences.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - The griffon divebombs and lifts one of the minions away.
  > - The unicorn rubs its horn on the knight's leg, fully healing them.
  > - The sirens lure the weak-willed into the water with their song.

- **More tenacious**. Use a clock to represent their agility, constitution, willpower, or a group working together as one unit.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - The pixie swarm is incredibly hard to pin down.
  > - The animated armor has no flesh, requiring you to pulverize it.
  > - The squad of soldiers acts as one unit.

In the end, if you feel more comfortable using adventurer mechanics to model other foes, by all means do that! It's easy enough to apply a tier system to enemies and give them hearts, passives, and moves. Go with what you feel the most comfortable with. However, the most powerful enemies eclipse the power of a tier 4 adventurer, so you could do something like expand and give them multiple passives, a defense clock that protects their hearts, or three each of offensive and defensive moves. Play around with the mechanics and get a feel for what works best!

## One Last Full Moon

The full moon is out and the town is in chaos. An angry mob of farmfolk has stormed the mayor's estate, banging on the gates. The dire wolf paces relentlessly in its cage in the town square. The PCs are watching from a hill outside town. The assault begins.

[context]: # (example of play)
>
> **GM**: Ulrot, what's the plan again? I wanna make sure that I get this engagement roll right.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: The minions push this big tree on wheels - I mean, battering ram - down the hill. I ride it straight towards the mayor's gate. Just before it hits, I toss the *firebombs* over the top at the archers and bail off. Everyone else will be running in behind me.
>
> **GM**: That's just crazy enough to work. The mayor's expecting some trouble, but I think the angry mob is giving you cover. Should be 3d, but let's go with 2d because of that short-fused *firebomb* you're using.

> **The GM rolls 2d engagement and gets a failure!**
>
> **GM**: Yeah, this is gonna be a mess. Your minions start pushing you down the hill and you're just flying. You get the firebombs ready and say to yourself, "Okay, on three. One, two, thr-" BOOM. That short-fused one goes off too early and the ram turns into a rolling ball of flame that slams into the gate - which somehow doesn't break! You start off bloodied, with archers up above, and angry farmfolk all around.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I'll resist that damage with... ***Smash***? Nah, that doesn't really make sense. Ah, I got it. I'll Scan to notice the short fuse and jump off earlier. I just took Rawhide, too, so that gives me +1d.
>
> **Ulrot rolls 2d ***Scan*** (1d + 1d) and gets a success!**
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Nice, and no stress either because of ***Rawhide***! As I count to "2," I remember Slem's voice in my head. My eyes get real big and in like slow-motion, I yell, "Ohhhhh shiiiiiiiit!" dropping the firebomb and rolling off the ram.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: From way back behind, I yell, "I tried to tell ya!" Then I duck behind some houses and ***Skulk*** to the mayor's estate to slip over the wall.
>
> **GM**: Everyone is pretty distracted, so it's <ins>strong</ins> effect. A mixed or a success here will get you over that wall unseen.
>
> **Slem rolls 3d ***Skulk*** and gets a failure!**
>
> **GM**: As your's sneaking behind the houses, you hear the wolf pack howling as they enter town. They saw the fire. Then a different howl, a bit more distant, sends chills down your spine. It's the werewolf. Distracted, you don't notice the occult slayer standing in your path until it's too late.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I use my gear defense against detection from my cloak. He thinks he saw something, but the flourish hides my movements... and then, I strike, again with ***Skulk***, from the side.
>
> **GM**: I'm going to give you <ins>weak</ins> effect here because his passive is "a sixth sense against danger." He feels it coming, his crossbow readied.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Guess I'll have to go hard then. I don't even try to skirt around him - I just leap from the shadows straight into the path of the crossbow. I get +1d from my ***Pounce*** ability, too.
>
> **GM**: Cool, normal effect but it's <ins>dire</ins> now.
>
> **Slem rolls 4d ***Skulk*** (3d + 1d) and gets a success!**
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I jump out of the shadows, up and over the crossbow, and come down to wedge the knife into his collar.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Yeah, he's going to make a defensive move here.
>
> **The GM rolls 4d defensive move and gets a success!**
>
> **GM**: As you leap, he drops the crossbow and uses your momentum to throw you through a window. He loses sight of you again and the crossbow is on the ground, but he avoids getting hit. Let's cut away there for a bit - Crag, you hear the howling. What are you up to?
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: After Slem disappears, I beeline for that cage to let the dire wolf out.
>
> **GM**: As you enter the town square, you see the archers up on the walls about to fill Ulrot with arrows, but then the howling starts.
>
> **The GM rolls 1d fortune (wolves) and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: The wolves dash into town and straight at the angry mob. The archers let loose arrows, taking down some wolves. All hell is breaking loose!
