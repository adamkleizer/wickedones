# Sandboxes

> “Blend in?! You're a 400 pound bugbear for fuck's sake. How the hell do you plan on blending in? Just... try using your heads for once instead of throwing yourself at the first idea that crops up in those pea brains of yours.”

&mdash; Marlog, Demon Marauder

## Choosing a Sandbox

A dungeon exists in a rather localized region. Its static nature means it can only affect a limited area. You work together to create a sandbox, a small region full of dominoes for you to knock over. First, you choose a map, whether from this book or another source, then define a series of light, neutral, and dark factions that exist within that sandbox. This gives each player input on the type of factions they want to interact with.

It's important that the region is local. Keeping the travel distance from the dungeon to the edge of the map to about two to four days is ideal. The Wicked Ones can't spend long periods of time away from their dungeon. Giving minions such an opportunity to turn against you is foolhardy and your hoard would surely be raided while you're gone.

Once you have your map, you fill it with factions, the groups that inhabit and control points on the map. This sandbox, filled with factions of varying size, power, and motivation, creates a pressure cooker environment where any interaction is likely to see a faction angered, setting events into motion.

### Factions

Factions are the groups that inhabit the sandbox prior to the arrival of your dungeon. Each sandbox has likely hit a balance, with factions pushing and pulling against each other until their relations have hit some kind of equilibrium. Everything on the map is under some faction's sway and if you want your dungeon to grow, you're going to have to take that power from another faction. Factions are split up into the following three basic categories:

- **Light factions** often consist of races generally seen as "civilized" such as humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings. Light factions speak a common tongue called the Light Tongue.
- **Dark factions** often consist of races generally seen as "monstrous" such as bugbears, goblins, kobolds, orcs, slissiks, trolls, ogres, troglodytes, cyclopes, hobgoblins, and dark elves. Dark factions speak a common tongue called the Dark Tongue.
- **Neutral factions** often consist of races that don't generally get placed within the above two groups: gnomes, ratfolk, centaurs, lizardfolk, satyrs, dryads, nymphs, merfolk, sprites, pixies, and giants. Neutral factions might speak their own language or one of the other common tongues.

"Good" and "evil" aren't the best way to represent factions, as a tribe of evil humans could certainly exist, though they speak the Light Tongue and never consider cooperating with more "monstrous" races. "Civilized" is another loaded term that mostly just correlates to having organized kingdoms. **These lines and where factions exist within them are up to each group.** It's important, however, for a hard language and cultural barrier to exist between the light and dark factions. The lack of communication helps explain their animosity towards each other.

Factions are rated from tier 0 to tier 4 depending on their size and the threat they represent to the dungeon. A faction's tier determines how quickly they work towards their goals and how difficult it is for your dungeon to raid targets that belong to them. Their power is relative to each other, with tier 4 factions established first and then all other factions compared to them as they scale downwards in relative power. This hierarchy might look something like this:

- **Tier 4 factions**: A large orc tribe, a walled town with a few hundred people, and a garrison of the far-away duke's soldiers.
- **Tier 3 factions**: A reclusive wizard's tower, a gargoyle colony, and a river town.
- **Tier 2 factions**: Woods filled with various fae, hill trolls, and forest rangers attached to the garrison.
- **Tier 1 factions**: A traveler's tavern, farmers around the walled town, and a goblin cannibal tribe.
- **Tier 0 factions**: Displaced kobolds, river sylphs, and a tiny forest shrine.

A single large entity on the map, such as a large town, might have multiple factions within it. For example, you might split it up into a tier 4 noble faction, a tier 2 clergy faction, and a tier 1 farmers faction. Tier 0 factions are not detailed on the map.

#### Faction Clocks

Each faction has a clock or two that represent goals the faction is working towards. Between each session, no matter how the cycle of play is progressing, the GM should roll the faction's tier as a fortune roll and tick away at their clocks, representing progress towards their goals and simulates the world moving. The GM can also do this narration together at the table from time to time, to get players involved.

When the clocks fill up, the goal is realized and the GM brings this new situation into play. These goals generally focus on interactions with other factions or even the dungeon. When a faction clock brings them up against another faction, opposed fortune rolls to determine how the confrontation goes down work well. The clocks are set and managed by the GM. Events within the game might also tick or even finish them. The segments on the clock are determined by how hard the goal is to accomplish. Check out the pre-made sandboxes for examples of faction goals.

### Pre-Made Sandboxes

Over the following pages, there are four sandbox maps that you can use with lists of example factions and faction clocks. The examples make for interesting campaigns, though it's recommended that you actually **<ins>make your own</ins>** factions and clocks together. This helps get players more invested in the world! Some sandboxes may also need a special rule or two to represent what is unique about them, such as Colonial Seas needing ships to play a big part of the campaign, or the importance of moving unseen in the City Sewers sandbox.
