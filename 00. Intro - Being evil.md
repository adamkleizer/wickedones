# Intro - Being evil

> "We prowl in darkness. We raid and pillage.  
We worship dark gods. We sow terror and discord.  
We build our dungeons. We slay those who trespass.  
We are Wicked Ones. And you're in our demesne."

&mdash; Mallus, Demon Zealot of Talazar

## What’s This Game About?

*Wicked Ones* is a game about a group of evil monsters building a dungeon. You build traps and other defenses to keep the hoard you gather out of the hands of the greedy adventurers coming to steal it away. You play to find out just how long you can survive against the inevitable onslaught of heroism your misdeeds bring. You find out why monsters need to hoard all that gold, who builds all those traps, and how much fun killing adventurers is. **You're the villains of this story. You are Wicked Ones.**

Monsters are deeply flawed creatures, driven by base desires. There are those, however, who are able to keep their baser impulses in check, rally others to their cause, and focus on a grander scheme. These formidable individuals are known among monsterkind as Wicked Ones. You play a group of them that, in understanding there is strength in numbers, have banded together in order to build a dungeon from scratch. You raid civilized lands, gather a hoard, cause mayhem, cast dark rituals, discover long forgotten things deep in the earth, slay heroes, and suffer blowback from your evildoing, all while working towards accomplishing your master plan.

However, you’re not just fantasy monsters randomly causing chaos and mayhem. Monsters come and go, but the dungeon outlives them, binds them together, and gives them a purpose. You map it out in detail as it’s built, then breathe life into it through play with events like revelry after a victorious raid, calamity striking as a tunnel collapses on your minions, or facing off against adventurers who dare enter your sanctum. **Your dungeon is the main character of this story.**

### Sandboxes, not Settings

While it’s assumed that your story is taking place in a fantasy world, there is no base setting for the game. With a dungeon, what's most important is its immediate vicinity as it’s inextricably tied to the region surrounding it. Players work together to craft a sandbox, a map full of factions and points of interest for your dungeon to get involved with. Make it a pressure cooker where any action you take is bound to have some blowback. There are several sandbox maps later in this book that you can fill with factions, but the game works better if you create your own!

### Forged in the Dark

*Wicked Ones* is a *Forged in the Dark (FitD)* game, based on the system mechanics and unique playstyle developed by John Harper for the game *Blades in the Dark*. In that game, you play dangerous scoundrels who risk everything for fortune. *FitD* games focus on intense periods of zoomed-in action where events unfold in interesting ways without the need for excessive planning by the players. It has a flexible resolution system that lets you get creative with character actions. It’s all about cutting to the action and getting to the good parts. It makes for wonderfully chaotic stories where no matter what you do, things are bound to go wrong - because that’s what happens to scoundrels in Blades or monsters building a dungeon. 

### Touchstones and Tone

More than anything else, this game was influenced by the PC game *Dungeon Keeper*. If you’ve played it, or its spiritual successor *War for the Overworld*, you already have the right feel for *Wicked Ones*. Some other video games were a huge inspiration as well, such as *Dwarf Fortress*, *Rimworld*, and *Overlord*. As for tabletop RPGs, of course *Blades in the Dark* gave a ton of ideas for creating a dangerous world that monsters inhabit, but *Saga of the Goblin Horde*, *No Country for Old Kobolds*, and *Goblin Quest* also provided great insight for portraying the perspective of a monster.

It’s important for the GM and the players to create the right tone for the game together. It shouldn't be cartoony and the monsters aren’t bumbling fools - they’re vicious killers with dark hearts filled with malice. There are some laughs to be had, but have no illusion - monsters aren’t misunderstood. They’re fundamentally evil, by their very nature. Bask in choosing the greater of two evils because being the villain is what *Wicked Ones* is all about!

On the other hand, going too dark all the time isn’t going to be fun for the players - so there’s a bit of a human aspect to the story. The monsters have motivations, goals, and even things they love, whether it be a pile of trinkets or a growing skull collection. In the end, you’re in this together. The dungeon, built from scratch, is your home and it’s all you’ve got. So while your awful nature might wear you down, you still want to protect what’s important to you. The game presents a balance of goal-oriented gameplay to compliment this exploration of darker themes. When it comes to evildoings, sometimes less is more - seeing it too often decreases its impact and makes it fall flat, and the game mechanics support this idea in play.

### What You Need to Play

Before you get started, make sure to have gathered up the following:
- **This book**: While the game is based on the *FitD* framework, it does not require *Blades in the Dark* to play. This game is completely standalone.
- **A bit of knowledge**: You’re going to need to have a basic understanding of what a tabletop roleplaying game is. This book doesn’t cover these core concepts. Wikipedia has an article that serves as a good place to start.
- **Some dice**: Grab a handful of six-sided dice, ideally four or more per person.
- **A gamemaster**: One person needs to be the gamemaster (GM). The GM plays as the world and is responsible for bringing it to life, making it a dangerous place full of ripe opportunities for the monsters to thrive in.
- **Players**: Two to four people who take on the role of the monsters building the dungeon. The players are responsible for weaving awesome stories with their characters’ antics and mayhem.
- **Paper and pencils**: Grab character sheets, a GM sheet, a dungeon sheet, and quick reference guides online at [banditcamp.io](https://banditcamp.io). Each player needs a calling sheet of their choice. Pencils work best for drawing the dungeon!

## Gameplay Overview

It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the overall structure of the game and some key terms that’ll be used moving forward. Don’t worry too much about understanding all of the terms. Try to get a sense of how the game works overall first. When you get confused about how the rules all tie together, you can come back and read this section again to help fill in the gaps.

*Wicked Ones* is a game driven by character action, which means the GM doesn’t usually roll for non-player character (NPC) actions. The players do almost all of the rolling by declaring what their characters do. The world and NPCs then act based on the roll results. In this way, every roll by a player covers both their own character’s actions and the actions of the world around them.

| Callings |
|:--:|
| brute |
| conniver |
| crafter |
| hunter |
| marauder |
| shadow |
| shaman |
| warlock |
| zealot |

You start the game by choosing a **dungeon theme**, which helps players make characters that have similar ambitions. It also gives you a set of **rooms** that you can build within your dungeon. Players then make player characters (PCs) by choosing a **calling** from the list above. Your calling defines what abilities your character has access to.

| Dungeons |
|:--:|
| enclave |
| forge |
| hideout |
| stronghold |
| temple |

You draw out your dungeon in detail on the **dungeon sheet**, including its **rooms**, **traps**, **locks**, and the **creatures** that inhabit it. You gather a hoard and protect it from **adventurers**. When the adventurers enter your dungeon, your **minions** confront them on the first level while the PCs wait in the **sanctum** for a titanic final confrontation.

Each character has a set of nine **actions** rated from 0 to 3 dots which are used when you want your character to do something. Before you make a roll, the GM determines the position and effect of the roll. **Position** is a measure of how bad the consequences will be if you fail, while **effect** is a measure of how large of an impact you will have if you succeed. When you want to do something, you declare your intent and what action you’d like to use. The GM gives you the position and effect and you then decide whether to roll or not.

You roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the action rating you chose, then you take the highest result from the roll. If it’s a 1, 2, or 3, it’s a **failure** and you suffer a **consequence** determined by how bad your position was. A 4 or 5 is a **mixed**, meaning you manage to accomplish your goal but suffer a consequence as well. If you roll a 6, it’s a **success** and you accomplish it without any consequences. Two 6s is a **critical** and you get an awesome extra benefit along with your success.

Consequences come in many forms, such as taking **shock**, becoming **bloodied**, the situation worsening, a weapon breaking, or enemy reinforcements arriving. Taking another serious wound while bloodied kills you. When you suffer a consequence, you can roll an action to **resist** it, reducing the impact of the consequence or maybe even negating it entirely. When you resist, you take an amount of **stress** depending on the roll. Stress is a resource every character has that allows them to keep their **dark impulse** in check. Characters can also spend stress to empower abilities they have, like casting powerful spells or using monstrous strength.

Your dark impulse rests within your monstrous heart, constantly beckoning you away from the tasks at hand. You can be **compelled** to follow through on a dark impulse, taking an action that plays towards it. Doing so rewards you with a **dark heart**, a bankable die that you can add to a later roll. You can also spend stress to 
suppress the compel. However, when you take too much stress, you snap and **go feral**, giving in to your dark impulse completely, having to immediately take an action that directly plays into it.

The game progresses through four phases: lurking, calamity, raiding, and blowback. You begin the **lurking phase** with **recovery**, clearing all of your stress and healing all of your wounds. You then pile your loot from the previous raid onto your hoard and partake in revelry, earning gold, dark hearts, and items. You can then take a **downtime action** that you can use to build your dungeon, craft **inventions** and **potions**, recruit **minions**, and so on. The minions you control can also be paid to perform downtime actions. When the **lurking phase** ends, you go through the **calamity phase** where the GM rolls to see if any **calamity** happened within your dungeon such as minions revolting or tunnels collapsing.

During the **raiding phase**, you get ready to head out of your dungeon. You select a **target**, choose a **plan**, and provide a few **details**. The GM then rolls **engagement** and you skip directly to the first steps of the raid plan unfolding. Raids are where the bulk of the action in the game happens, as you hit targets for the gold and materials your dungeon needs. After the raid winds down, you go through the **blowback phase** where the GM rolls to see if your actions caused any **blowback**, such as an ambush waiting for you or targets along a prosperous trade route drying up.

Calamity and blowback sometimes result in **dungeon invasions** as a group of powerful adventurers show up at your dungeon, though **adventurers** might also show up as a result of events within the story. The PCs, like any evil dungeon boss, await them in their sanctum and make their **minions**, **creatures**, **locks**, **traps**, and **tricks** attempt to fend them off. If the adventurers manage to make their way into the **sanctum**, the PCs face off against them in a final battle. After looting the bodies and enjoying some post-defense revelry, you jump right back into the phase cycle and continue raiding and pillaging the overworld.

## Player Best Practices

*Wicked Ones* and the *Forged in the Dark* system are best enjoyed when players are all on the same page when it comes to how they approach the game. By trying to follow a few simple guidelines below, you’ll get the most out of the game. The game’s not adversarial and there are no winners - you’re all sitting down to tell a cool story about monsters. Here’s some advice on how to make that story really entertaining:
- **You’re a monster, so act like one!** This should almost go without saying, but your character is a monster. They’re evil. They don’t have human hang-ups. They look at the world differently than humans do. Try to get into that mindset. Try to figure out what things motivate a monster and what it treasures. Think of their attitude towards their allies. Don’t be afraid to throw other characters into harm’s way, though remember that monsters can have friends, too.
- **Describe what’s going on.** After you roll, take the reins and tell everyone what’s happening. Even if a consequence is coming your way, narrate up to the point where the GM cuts in to tell you how everything went horribly wrong. The more you describe your actions, the better the story comes to life for everyone. As a player, you should be narrating every roll you make.
- **Don’t be a weasel.** You’ll have the urge to manipulate the mechanics for the easiest way to your goal - fight that urge. It's natural to want to roll the most dice or exploit some powerful loophole, but *Wicked Ones* isn’t really a game to be won. Try to do what your PC would do in that situation then decide which mechanics resolve it. Be honest about what your PC is feeling or doing in a situation and let the mechanics generate drama and push the game forward.
- **Don’t run from danger, embrace it.** The fun in the game happens when the biggest stakes are on the line. Monsters don’t always weigh risk vs. reward, and neither should you. If you think something sounds fun to try, don’t talk yourself out of it. Throw caution to the wind and grab some dice.
- **When in doubt, listen to your dark impulse.** If you’re not sure what your monster would do in some situation, you can always lean heavily on your character’s impulse and see where it takes you.
- **It’s up to you to tell a cool story.** It’s not just on the GM to make the story amazing - it’s on all of you. Every person at the table is there to enjoy the same game and you all have the same level of responsibility. It’s easy to shuffle this over to the GM, but they have enough on their plate. Come to the session prepared, know the rules, step up and drive action, jump into other players' scenes, and help make suggestions when someone hits a wall creatively.
- **Cheer for your dungeon, not your character.** Your dungeon will outlive any monster character you’re playing - it’s the center of the story here. Don’t worry about losing a character, just promote a minion from a pack to a Wicked One or bring in another fun-to-play monster.

## GM Best Practices

Just as players need to get into the right mindset, so too does the GM. The story and 
all its details are emergent. The GM doesn’t maintain a plotline. The dungeon grows 
over time as the players pursue their characters’ goals. You’re all telling the story 
together. Try to follow these guidelines to help create the right atmosphere at the 
table and let players know what to expect from you as a GM:
- **Be the PCs’ worst enemy and biggest fan.** When they fail, smack them with consequences without remorse, but when they pull off something awesome, be the first one to cheer their success. Don’t fall in love with your world and NPCs - they’re dominoes there for the PCs to knock over. Encourage them to do so.
- **Bring the world to life.** Give NPCs and locations some personality, even if it’s just a poignant detail or two. Think about how the monster PCs view them. Call them by distinctive characteristics - the boss with the fat belly, the lady with the whiny voice, the elf with a long nose. Make sure they’re more than just human A and B to kill. Make it feel like they exist in the world, have connections, and their loss is going to be felt.
- **Be the dark desires lurking in their hearts.** Challenge the PCs’ dark impulses any chance you get. Keep a list of them in front of you and give a bit of thought in advance to how you can tempt them away from the task at hand. The game is at its best when it all goes awry and their impulses tell you what direction the players want things to go in when it does.
- **Let the players drive the story.** The world is a sandbox of everyone’s creation and the players will be setting their own goals for their dungeon. Don’t get in their way - encourage them to create goals and suggest ways they can pursue them. Don’t push the story in a predefined direction. Let it develop naturally through player decision and play. Let them find their own way. They know their characters better than you.
- **Hand the narrative reins to the players.** Prompt the players to describe their intentions before they roll and ask them what it looks like after they roll. Even when rolls don’t go well, get them to describe how it goes right up until things go badly or even how they spectacularly fail. Let them describe how it didn’t work and set themselves up for the consequences coming their way.
- **Keep the game moving.** Push players towards decision - don’t let the game get wrapped up in endless debating options. Help them come to quick decisions and get back to the action.
- **Never forget that the world hates monsters.** The world is out to get them, so don’t pull your punches. The game’s supposed to be brutal. Give them good reason to hide behind their dungeon traps.

## How Evil is Too Evil?

You’re going to be playing evil monsters doing evil stuff, but there are various shades of evil. For the overall tone of the game, it tends to work best when the monsters are **wickedly evil**, maybe a bit **comically evil**, but definitely not **misunderstood evil**. The best way to think about it is that you’re the villain in a B movie. You’re the monsters a GM would run in any typical fantasy hack and slash game. When adventurers come kicking down your dungeon door, they’re doing what’s right. They’re the good guys and you’ve given them good reason to be there. This is a game where you have permission to be the bad guy - so try to jump right into the role!

That said, how evil should you be? That’s a question for each table to answer. When playing evil characters, it’s all too easy to push things too far. Things can get weird, uncomfortable, or just plain gross. Now if you’re into weird, uncomfortable, or just plain gross things, that could be fine - but it’s important to make sure that everyone else at the table is, too. So before you get started, it’s important to set the right tone and create a table where the game is well within everyone’s comfort zones. Luckily, we have some great safety tools developed by the roleplaying community to handle it. Whether you’re playing with a new group or even old friends, using one of the following methods can save you a lot of grief down the road.

In addition to implementing one or more of these tools, it can also be especially helpful to regularly check in with the group at the end of a session and ask if everyone felt comfortable with how the session went. Clearly posing the question makes it easier for all to speak up when they might otherwise be quiet and gives the group a chance to reevaluate the safety tools they've put in place.

### Lines & Veils

This fantastic method has been provided to the community by Ron Edwards in the game *Sex and Sorcery*. With Lines and Veils, players set some ground rules during the first session. You discuss things you would rather not have as a part of the game. You set **lines**, which are very clear limits on what can’t be brought up in game - it’s as if those things don’t even exist. They’re strictly off limits. You also set **veils**, which allow something to be brought up, but it has to happen off-screen. The scene can fade to black or if it’s something you roll for, you just make the roll and it’s accepted that it happens. You don’t need any details, you don’t roleplay through the events, but it having happened can affect the storyline moving forward.

### Movie Ratings

Sometimes the easiest way to set some limits is to just assign a rating to the game like it’s a movie. Is this game going to be G, PG, PG13, R, or NC-17 rated? This works particularly well along with the X-Card on the next page when you don’t really want to go through exactly what is and isn’t okay and just judge it more on the fly as the game progresses. Setting a rating can set a nice basis for what’s acceptable, then the X-Card on the next page can be used when you hit some uncomfortable territory.

### The X Card (Source: http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)

The X Card, a technique created by John Stavropoulos, is a great approach for making everyone at the table comfortable. The GM puts an index card with a big red X on it in the middle of the table, though it can be some other object or even just an agreed upon gesture. The point is to make it clear and easily accessible. If the game veers into uncomfortable territory, players can tap the card and signal to the GM that they’d like to move on. The player doesn’t have to explain why they tapped it, but is free to discuss it after the session if they’d like. The GM then moves the scene on or reworks it a bit to avoid that subject matter and everyone at the table knows it’s best avoided in the future.

The strong point of the X-Card is how flexible it is - you sometimes don’t know what’s uncomfortable to you until you’re confronted with it. Bringing it up at that time might be a little difficult and players might even feel like they’re interrupting other people’s fun. The X-Card is an agreement between all players that it’s fine to interrupt if you don’t like what’s going on - that everyone having a good time and being comfortable with the story is the most important thing.

> **GM**: "Okay, so let’s go ahead and set some ground rules. Let’s not let the evil get too out of hand. I’m down with an R rating for the game, but let’s do Lines and Veils, too. I wanna throw out a few of my own to get started. First, there’s no rape, it’s strictly off-limits, even in a vague "raping and pillaging" sense. Other sex stuff is fine off-camera like a couple of bugbears hooking up or whatever, but there’s no way I’m roleplaying through that."
>
> **John**: "Let’s avoid anything involving children, like, no hurting kids. I feel like they can be around if it's important to set a scene, but maybe they just always get away or something."
>
> **Matt**: "I’m not so cool with gory blood stuff. Some is fine, of course, but I don’t really want to listen to a long description of it."
>
> **Jenny**: "What about torture? I mean, it's in-genre. Could we maybe do that, but keep it light on the goriness? It’s mostly about gathering info and one of the only ways monsters have to get it."
>
>(This talk continues until everyone feels pretty comfortable.)
>
> **GM**: "And just so everyone knows, I’m going to be using the X-Card so I’ll just put a card out here in the middle of the table. If we accidentally break some of our ground rules or if we hit on something uncomfortable or weird that we haven’t talked about yet, just tap the card and we’ll move on. I’ll wrap up or go back and rework the scene a bit, no questions asked. We can then talk about it more after the session if you'd like."

### A Place to Call Home

During the first session, the PCs' main task is finding a place to set up their dungeon. As this needs to be a prime location, it's likely to have somebody already there. Here we see our PCs about to launch a raid on a cave some merchants are camping in.

PCs:
- Ulrot [Orc Brute]
- Crag [Kobold Shaman]
- Slem [Slissik Shadow]

> **GM**: "The wind picks up, dousing your campfire in rain. It goes dark and you sit there shivering in the cold. Then suddenly, you hear something off in the distance - the sound of laughter. Then a voice - a human voice. They sound happy, like they're joking with a friend."
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: "You guys hear that? Sounds like someone's out of the rain. Ain't gonna be laughing like that if you're out here shivering your ass off."
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: "Yeah, screw this. Let's go chop 'em up. Maybe they have food."
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: "We don't even know how many are over there. Let's hold off until they go to sleep. Then we can sneak in and slit their throats."
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: "Pfft, no time for that. I grab my axe and and point off towards the voices. Food, no rain, human blood. Why wait?"
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: "I think I'm with Slem on this one. We have good cover and no idea what we're even facing in there. Better to be sneaky."
>
> **GM**: Sounds like a stealth raid to me. You guys are gonna figure out pretty quickly that this is a small merchant caravan holed up in a cave up ahead, waiting out the storm. What's your point of entry here?
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Keep it simple and go through the front. They might have a guard, so that'll be the first step. We'll wait until it's good and quiet and hopefully the rain can cover us.
>
> **GM**: You sticking together or splitting up?
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Splitting up. I can't Skulk at all, so I'm just gonna hang back and come charging in as soon as I hear a human voice. I'm the plan B.
>
> **GM**: Great, let's roll engagement and jump into the action. The rain gives you all cover and these guys are a bit drunk, so let's up it to 3d.
>
> **The GM rolls 3d engagement and gets a failure!**
>
> **GM**: You're going to start in a tight spot. Slem, you and Crag are moving through the forest, rain just pouring down. It's quiet as you approach the cave entrance, though you do catch the light glow of a dying fire. You don't see anyone on watch, but just as you get ready to head inside, you hear someone stumbling through the forest. Turning, you see a wide-eyed drunk mercenary coming back to his post after relieving himself.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: So I'm the closest to him since he came up behind us. I jump straight at him and try to ***Smash*** my hands over his mouth so he can't yell.
>
> **GM**: Sounds good. Let's see that roll.
>
> **Crag rolls 1d ***Smash*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: A mixed, okay... you do it, but he pulls a dagger and slashes your arm, giving you ***Muscles*** shock. Tell us what that looks like.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: He's a bit taller than me, so I grab the front of his shirt and sling myself up onto his back and just clamp my other hand over his mouth hard. Unfortunately, he was more keen to get that dagger out than yell.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Looks like I'm up. I see him waving that dagger around wildly with the kobold on his back. I'm just going to step up and slit his throat. It's just a quick slash, so I'm rolling ***Finesse***.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I'll assist for sure! I pull back on his face, exposing his throat.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. You have <ins>strong</ins> effect.
>
> **Slem rolls 2d ***Finesse*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: So I think with the <ins>strong</ins> effect, this guy is definitely dead. He was their toughest guy as well. But, it's gonna make some noise.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: The knife cuts a perfect line across his throat and his eyes go wide. I grin wickedly, then blood comes gushing out. But what was the noise?
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I got it! Right before you slit his throat, he bites real deep into my hand and I yelp! But I think I'm going to resist that and try to hold it in.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Hah, don't bother. So my dark impulse is reckless, right? Yeah, I think I'm getting impatient out here waiting and want a dark heart. Crag's yelp is drowned out by me charging past, yelling 'LET'S DO THIS!'
