## Dungeon Overview

Your dungeon is at the heart of your group. It’s your refuge, a place to plan your dastardly deeds, a strong defense against invaders, and a secure location to store your hoard. This section is an overview of how the dungeon works to keep in mind and refer back to while you read through the rules in this chapter.

Your group first chooses a **dungeon theme** together. This gives you a theme around which to base your characters and the campaign. Each theme also comes with a **core feature**, a strong ability related to the theme, and a list of **tier 3 rooms** that you can build within your dungeon to gain strong bonuses, though you have to acquire **materials** for them by raiding. The available **tier 1** and **tier 2 rooms** are the same for each dungeon theme. They give more general bonuses and don't require materials.

You start by finding a location for the dungeon, usually a place that needs its current inhabitants cleared out. After you have a location, you get out the **dungeon sheet**, a grid used for mapping out the dungeon together. You decide on some basic details for your dungeon such as what the floors are made of and what the lighting is like. The GM then draws the outside of the dungeon and any small caves or tunnels already existing in the location. They then roll for a discovery, something you happen across during your initial excavation. The players then draw the dungeon, taking turns picking from a list of dungeon features and drawing them out. Sometime during this process, the GM adds the discovery they rolled earlier to the map. In this way, both the GM and each player have some influence on the dungeon's layout.

You work together to choose a **master plan**, or at least detail the first steps of a plan that develops over time through play. Each plan always starts out the same, though - gathering a hoard. You gain wicked xp when you work towards each step. Over time, the final plan emerges from these steps and gives your group a goal to strive towards.

To grow in power, you increase your **hoard** by raiding the overworld. Your dungeon tier is based on the size of your hoard, ranging from tier 0 to tier 4. The hoard grows when you launch a successful **pillaging raid** against a target higher tier than your dungeon. This is a major looting raid, large enough to increase your dungeon in power. As your hoard grows, it attracts imps, creatures, and minions, as well as paying for their servitude and sustenance.

**Imps** are tiny, weak beings attracted to your dungeon looking for protection in return for basic services. They have a few descriptive traits that help you describe their presence in scenes, but they're mostly background elements that exist to handwave a lot of the minutiae of running the dungeon. Your imps also make one downtime action roll per lurking phase, chosen and rolled by the GM.

**Creatures** are unintelligent or independent powerful denizens of your dungeon that fill **lairs** that open up as your dungeon expands. These lairs function as a home for the creatures, drawing them in. Creatures don't directly serve you, though they're usually not hostile towards dungeon denizens and will fight any adventurers that wander by.

**Minions** are your direct servants, hired or recruited to do your bidding. They have enough intelligence to follow orders. Each player controls one pack of minions which acts as a secondary PC. They're detailed on your character sheet, and have their own actions. You can pay gold to upgrade them, have them perform downtime actions, or join you on raids.

**Adventurers** or other forces intent on your destruction occasionally wander into your dungeon looking to rid the world of your evil or to just get their greedy hands on your hoard. They might show up as a result of a bad blowback or calamity roll, when a faction clock dealing with your dungeon fills, or when the GM just feels like adventurers should show up. Because of this constant threat of invasion, your dungeon needs some security. You can build **traps** to try and kill them, **tricks** to manipulate their behavior, and **locks** to protect sensitive areas, pushing them towards other paths.

The dungeon is split into two levels. The first level connects directly to the overworld through the dungeon entrance and houses the majority of the dungeon, including all of your minions, creatures, rooms, and defenses. At the end of the first level is a staircase leading down to the second level. As your dungeon grows, you move the staircase to the new "end" of the first level, allowing it to grow over time. The staircase leads to the **sanctum**, where the Wicked Ones spend their time and where the hoard resides. The sanctum sets the stage for the final boss battle at the end of a dungeon invasion.

**Discoveries** are natural caves, tunnels, old buried structures, or mystical phenomenon that you find while digging underground. They might be helpful, harmful, or completely neutral depending on how the roll goes. You make a new discovery every time your dungeon tier increases. They're drawn by the GM and give some level of control over how the dungeon develops, letting them introduce chaos into your well-laid dungeon plans.

When adventurers enter your dungeon, your minions are scattered throughout the dungeon. You make a **starting location roll** to determine where they are. They might start out in just the right spot or be completely unaware an invasion is happening. As the adventurers move through your dungeon, you narrate how all of the traps, tricks, and locks try to repel the adventurers, how the creatures fair in defending their lairs, and how your minions stand between the adventurers and your sanctum. During this first level of dungeon defense, you take on the roll of your minions running around the dungeon trying to stop the adventurers.

The Wicked Ones, like any good dungeon boss, are unaware of what's going on upstairs. That's why they built all those traps in the first place. If the adventurers manage to make it through the first level, the GM rolls engagement to determine how the final climactic battle starts off as the adventurers descend into the sanctum.

## Dungeon Creation

You work together as a group to decide all of the details of the dungeon you will live in, then actually draw it out on the dungeon sheet. It grows over time, with the initial setup setting the stage for that growth and serving as a tutorial of sorts to introduce all of the different elements of running the dungeon. The dungeon creation process below gives the essentials of what needs covered to begin play. To make this process easier, the <ins>Starting a Campaign</ins> section integrates dungeon creation smoothly into the first few sessions of the campaign.

### 1. Choose a Dungeon Theme (PG. 176 - 185)

Choose a <ins>dungeon theme</ins>, making sure everyone agrees about what type of dungeon you want to build together and what its <ins>master plan</ins> might be. The dungeon theme also provides you with a list of rooms that you can build and you start off play with its **core feature**, a special benefit that the nature of your dungeon provides you with.

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Enclave
> - Forge
> - Hideout
> - Stronghold
> - Temple

### 2. Set the Dungeon Atmosphere

Answer the following questions to provide some details about what your dungeon is like and note them down on the dungeon sheet. Set up scenes and use power struggles to help make decisions when there are a few good options out there.

- **ENTRANCE: What does the dungeon’s entrance look like from the outside?**  
*It might be something like a natural cave with a stream flowing through it, a small hole in a sewer tunnel, the ruins of an abandoned church, or the trunk of an old, rotten tree.*
- **STRUCTURE: What are the floors and walls made of?**  
*They might be something like cold stone that's slightly damp to the touch, mud intertwined with roots, slick and warm black obsidian, or musty bricks stacked haphazardly.*
- **LIGHTING: What lights the dungeon and how dark is it?**  
*It might be something like torches in sconces lining the walls, magma flowing through the hallways, a magical illumination that clings to the ceiling, or glowing mushrooms growing in every room.*
- **ATMOSPHERICS: What sounds and smells greet those who enter?**  
*It might be something like fetid swamp water, overwhelming incense, rotting flesh, or sulfur and brimstone.*
- **HOARD: What makes up the piles of treasure in your hoard?**  
*It might be something like scattered coins and glowing crystals, stacks of weapons and armor, piles of junk and artifacts, or chests brimming with gold.*

### 3. Choose Your Imps (Pg. 187)

Soon after you clear out your dungeon location and set its atmosphere, <ins>imps</ins> begin to show up. The exact nature and personalities of your imps is up to you. Choose two of the traits below or make up your own to describe them:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Cowardly
> - Cruel
> - Manic
> - Noisy
> - Stupid
> - Surly
> - Troublesome

### 4. Build the Initial Dungeon

The players take turns drawing out the dungeon on the dungeon sheet, or you can choose one person to draw and have players give them directions. Having a conversation about drawing style prior to beginning is a good idea. Later in this chapter is a <ins>drawing guide</ins> with example dungeons to help.

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Drawing the Dungeon (Process)
> 1. **The GM draws the outside area**, the entrance leading in from at least one side of the dungeon sheet. This is usually a cliff face or small cave.
> 2. **The GM rolls a discovery**, but can draw it at any point during this process.
> 3. **The players take turns drawing.** A new dungeon has one of each of the features below. Players go around the table clockwise choosing and drawing a feature from the list until everything has been drawn. Some features are best discussed as a group before deciding.

[context]: # (complete list)
> > - Tier 1 Room
> > - Tier 2 Room
> > - Tier 3 Room (Missing Materials)
> > - Tier 1 Creature Lair
> > - Tier 1 Lock
> > - Tier 1 Trap
> > - Tier 1 Trick
> > - Sanctum
> 4. **Draw the stairway** leading down from the first floor to the sanctum. Then draw the stairway leading up to the first floor from the sanctum.
>> 5. **Name your dungeon.** Each player writes down an idea for a dungeon name. When finished, show the names and discuss. If you can't decide on a good one, the GM can initiate a power struggle to make the decision.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Making Decisions Can Be Difficult
> Some players are more decisive in making decisions than others. That's natural. It's the GM's job to help make everyone at the table comfortable, giving players some room to consider things when it's their turn to decide something, and finally pushing them gently towards landing on a choice. Some players might hesitate, but, it's a good practice to build an expectation that each player participates in the decision making process, but you can also give players an out and just let them pass when they hit a wall.

## Dungeon Features

While there are many types of dungeons out there, dungeons built by the Wicked Ones have a number of aspects in common. They're new dungeons, not built on old ruins, and are unique in many ways. They're built to grow rapidly and mainly serve as a base of operations from which to launch raids and a safe haven from any trouble you stir up when doing so.

Every dungeon has two levels. The first level houses all of your minions, rooms, traps, locks, and so on. This is the buffer layer between you and the surface and its primary purposes is to take the brunt of any adventurer assault on your dungeon. At the end of this layer is a stairway leading down to the second level where your sanctum lies. This is where the Wicked Ones wait to face off against any adventurers who make it through the dungeon's defenses.

As you lay out the dungeon's defenses, the element of surprise is key. If adventurers come up against similar defenses, such as multiple traps in a row, they're going to be on high alert which reduces the effectiveness of that defense type.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Repeated Defenses**: Dungeon defenses take -1d on any rolls if a similar defense was the last thing the invaders encountered. Minions, creatures, traps, tricks, and locks are all affected by this.

### Hoard & Tier

Your dungeon is rated from tier 0 to tier 4, representing its power relative to other factions and invading adventurers. You start off at tier 0 and the tier is tied directly to the hoard, which is all of the gold, treasure, food, materials, and resources you’ve dragged into your dungeon from the overworld. The hoard draws in creatures to serve you and as it grows, so too does your dungeon’s power.

**The dungeon's tier represents training and equipment.** The GM compares the dungeon's tier to an adventurer's or other enemy's tier when judging if they're more powerful than the Wicked Ones or the dungeon's denizens. This is a circumstance that counts towards position and effect.

**The dungeon's tier represents raiding power.** The GM compares the dungeon's tier to a faction's tier to determine if the target you're raiding has an advantage against you. These advantages might be things like better equipment or training, larger numbers, or more powerful magic. As your dungeon grows more powerful, you can raid targets belonging to more powerful factions.

When facing tougher enemies, you might start an encounter with a lower engagement roll or even with consequences already inflicted. You might have difficulty overcoming challenges as your effect is limited or face greater risks as you find yourself in over your head. The opposite is also true, though. When facing weaker enemies, you enjoy a decisive advantage over them.

#### Increasing Dungeon Tier

You grow your hoard by launching a <ins>pillaging raid</ins> against a target belonging to a faction at least 1 tier higher than your current dungeon tier. If successful, your dungeon’s tier increases during the next <ins>recovery</ins> and the target's faction tier drops by one. The hoard can only grow by taking wealth from a more powerful faction, proving that you have the power to belong in the new tier. When your tier increases, it has the following effects:
- **New Discovery**: Imps dig deep into the earth, leading to a <ins>discovery</ins>.
- **New Creature Lair**: Add a <ins>creature lair</ins> equal to your dungeon tier and detail
the creature that inhabits it.
- **More Imps**: Imps roll the dungeon tier for their <ins>downtime action</ins>.
- **Power Growth**: The power of PCs and the dungeon denizens grow, used to
compare against raid targets and adventurers.

#### Losing the Hoard

You could lose your hoard in a few ways, though it's pretty rare to lose hoard without the entire dungeon falling. A bad calamity roll might push minions to riot and make off with part of your hoard. Adventurers could bust into your sanctum, take you down, and flee with part of it. An enormous dragon could demand part of your hoard when you try to strike a deal with them. When you lose hoard, you don't lose the benefits of your tier but must reclaim or replace what was taken.

### Dungeon Duties

The dungeon is a complex beast and each player has to take an active role in running it. On each character sheet is a place to list your dungeon duties, those parts of the dungeon that you alone are responsible for. When something is added to the dungeon that must be taken care of, narrated, or rolled for in some way, it's added to a player's sheet and they're responsible for bringing it into the game. If one player ends up with too many dungeon duties, you can spread these out to other players, even if they didn't work on that part of the dungeon.

Locks, creatures, traps, and tricks are always added to this list. Dungeon rooms or discoveries might need to be as well. Even certain types of decision making or drawing can be added to the list if your group decides to delegate those tasks instead of working on them together.

### Master Plan

Every dungeon has a master plan, a purpose for existing. You work together to choose a plan that aligns well with your theme, the characters you’re playing, and the <ins>sandbox</ins> you’ve set up. In this way, you can determine together what you want the game to be about and be rewarded for playing towards those goals.

[context]: # (important rule)
> You earn 1 wicked xp in each session that you work towards the steps in your master plan. This is a group trigger, so either all PCs get it or nobody does.

Your first step is simple - **grow the hoard**. Setting up initial rooms, hiring minions, and eventually pillaging a higher tier target all work towards this first fundamental step. Once that step is completed and you're tier 1, you establish the next step in your plan. You don't need to decide on what the final step is until it becomes clearer later through play. Your PCs might have known the plan all along, but the players can figure it out as you go along. You only need to know what the next step is.

Each step should be broad enough to take 2 or 3 sessions to accomplish, usually needing a couple of raids. If a step becomes meaningless, is too narrow, or you lose focus on it, you can mark it off and write in another one instead.

[context]: # (example of play)
> #### Corrupt the Woodlands Forever
> - **Step 1**: *Grow the hoard.*
> - **Step 2**: *Clear the northern woods of foresters and loggers.*
> - **Step 3**: *Unite the monster tribes of the forest.*
> - **Step 4**: *Wage war on the fae and bring down the dryad queen.*
> - **Step 5**: *Break the queen and reveal the location of the forest heart.*

> - **Step 5**: *Spread disease amongst the castle defenders.*
> - **Final Step**: *Introduce the now chaotic region to Melkahar, the god of pestilence and decay.*

### Dungeon Themes

Every dungeon is built around a central theme, chosen together as a group before the dungeon is built. The theme gives you a **core feature** related to the nature of the dungeon and a set of tier 3 rooms that you can build within it. Each dungeon also has a **flexibility slot** which you can use to build a tier 3 room from another theme.

The theme keeps players all on the same page thematically, allowing you to design characters that fit in well with the theme or fill a unique niche, as well as choosing steps in your master plan that go along with the theme. The choice of dungeon theme is a statement about what kind of things the players want to do in the game. You can choose from the following themes and their tier 3 rooms:

- **Enclave**: Tapping Into the Arcane. Choose this dungeon theme if you want your dungeon to be mystical from top to bottom. Its core function is ***twisted landscape***, corrupting the area surrounding your dungeon. An Enclave has the following tier 3 rooms: ***academy***, ***crucible***,  **greenery***, ***library***, ***potion lab***, ***scrying pool***, and ***spawning chamber***.
- **Forge**: The Power of Industry. Choose this dungeon theme if you want a dungeon full of monstrous inventions and steampunk tech. Its core function is ***power source***, boosting the productivity and defenses of your dungeon. A Forge has the following tier 3 rooms: ***alchemist lab***, ***guild hall***, ***factory***, ***mineshaft***, ***testing chamber***, ***vehicle bay***, and ***workshop***.
- **Hideout**: Keeping Your Head Low. Choose this dungeon theme if you want to work as a cohesive unit and manipulate the factions of the region. Its core function is ***agents of chaos***, allowing you to strongly influence faction clocks. A Hideout has the following tier 3 rooms: ***dojo***, ***gambling den***, ***gear locker***, ***obstacle course***, ***planning room***, ***roost***, and ***tavern***.
- **Stronghold**: Through Strength of Arms. Choose this dungeon theme if you want to face challenges with pure military might. Its core function is ***warband***, giving you a powerful minion that can raid the region. A Stronghold has the following tier 3 rooms: ***barracks***, ***bestiary***, ***fighting pit***, ***funeral pyre***, ***smithy***, ***war drums***, and ***war room***.
- **Temple**: Serving a Greater Power. Choose this if you want to focus on a certain god and its domains. Its core function is ***divine intervention***, which you can use to cast a tier 3 spell from your god. A temple has the following tier 3 rooms: ***altar***, ***antechamber***, ***augury circle***, ***dormitory***, ***reliquary***, ***penance chamber***, ***scriptorium***.

[context]: # (important rule)
> The room descriptions on the following pages refer to *you* or *the dungeon*.
> - <ins>You</ins> means the room bonus applies to each PC individually.
> - <ins>The dungeon</ins> means it applies once to the group of PCs as a whole.

## Enclave

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Tapping into the Arcane

An Enclave is infused with magic. Arcane energy lingers in the air, runes are scrawled on the walls, and even the lowliest of minions may have some level of magical aptitude. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Twisted Landscape***: Arcane energy corrupts the area around the dungeon. Establish its range, increasing with tier, and how it manifests (choose 3): *corrupted wildlife* - *dark whispers* - *illusions* - *inclement weather* - *living plants* - *wisps*. These act as a trap and a trick equal to the dungeon tier against invaders.

### Enclave Tier 3 Rooms

#### Academy

Young monsters come to study and learn arcane secrets. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Invoke*** as their primary action and the *adept* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*An academy might need crystal balls, mantles, or wands.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I walk in to see a mishmash of young monsters slaving away at the spell memorization they've been assigned. I spot a group of lazy goblins hanging out in the back, avoiding their work. They're perfect for the job."

#### Crucible

The mystical power of this room enchants items. Each downtime, it can either produce a single tier 1 magic item or tick a magic item creation clock twice. You must still provide the special requirements for tier 2 and 3 magic items.

*A crucible might need an essence core, a mystical beast, or magical helpers.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "One of your kobolds runs up to you holding a dwarf skull. Excitedly, she puts it on like a helmet. When she speaks, the skull's mouth moves and it sounds like the dead dwarf's voice!"

#### Greenery

This garden of voracious plants will devour living prey. Feed them to harvest (choose one): *a plant-based shared supply* - *special ingredients for potions*, *a few doses of a concoction*. The higher the tier, the better the harvest. This room is also a trap equal to your dungeon tier.

*A greenery might need rare plants, fertilizer, or artificial sunlight.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "We drag the scout into the room and toss him onto the floor. The plants wake up and turn to look at him, baring their teeth. Later in the day, I return to pick some of the fruit they've grown."

#### Library

Books are the key to knowledge of the world. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about the history, cultures, or arcana of the world. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A library might need a trove of books, large bookshelves, or a librarian.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I leaf through some old dusty tomes, looking up the duke's lineage and find out that his succession was illegitimate. The true heir is still alive."

#### Potion Lab

Your imps have learned how to make potions. The dungeon chooses a single magic path of which you have a steady supply of all tier 1 potions and a single tier 2 potion.

*A potion lab might need brewing equipment, special ingredients, or a giant cauldron.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The slissiks knock over a shelf full of Spiderlegs potions, dumping them on the adventurers. Let's see how they react to growing spider legs!"

#### Scrying Pool
The pool reveals far away scenes. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about an NPC’s recent activity. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon. *What question or object do you present to the pool to guide its gaze?*

*A scrying pool might need cursed water, mosaic tiles, or a center figurine.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I toss the insignia into the pool and ask, 'Where's the captain now?' As the ripples settle, it shows me a clear image of the captain riding with a few men. I recognize the area instantly. 'He's on the south road. Let's go.'"

#### Spawning Chamber

Minions are grown or summoned here, easily replacing your losses. Once per dungeon defense, a copy of a slain minion pack can burst forth from this spawning chamber. You can also add the *expendable* upgrade to minions for free.

*A spawning chamber might need mystical goo, glass containers, or magic seeds.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "My orc grunts rip themselves out of the ooze sacks they were growing in. They follow their instincts, grabbing an axe off the wall and heading down the tunnel towards the adventurers."

## Forge

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> The Power of Industry

A Forge is built for production - inventions, factories, steamworks, and alchemy can be found throughout the complex. Problems are approached with ingenuity, eagerness, and a keen disregard for danger. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Power Source***: In a forge, your sanctum is a source of power fueling your dungeon, such as a volcano, a steamworks, or a waterwheel. During downtime, you can take +1d on a single downtime action. During dungeon defense, you can take +1d on a single lock, trap, or trick on your list of dungeon duties.

### Forge Tier 3 Rooms

#### Alchemist Lab

Your imps are always hard at work mixing reagents. You have a steady supply of all tier 1 concoctions.

*An alchemist lab might need alchemy equipment, chests full of reagents, or recipes.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "KABOOM! An explosion in the lab showers a minion pack with beastlure and broken glowsticks falling off the shelves. From down the hall outside, you hear the sniffing of wargs."

#### Guild Hall

You let your minions organize to better their working and living conditions. In truth, you ignore their demands, but the illusion of having some control reduces grumbling. The dungeon takes +1d on calamity rolls.

*A guild hall might need benches, a long table, or scribing tools.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Your minions are sitting in the guild hall having a guild meeting. You see one of the kobold alchemists pounding a gavel, calling the meeting to order. Then suddenly, BAM - the door is kicked in by adventurers."

#### Factory

Your imps relentlessly sweat away in the factory. Each downtime, they can either produce a single tier 1 contraption or tick a contraption clock twice.

*A factory might need metal casing for a boiler, piles of coal, or raw iron.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I wake up heavily hungover, lying on a table. I turn my head to see machinery and tools tossed about, the result of my drunken rampage. The imps are all scowling at me. I guess they can't work this downtime."

#### Mineshaft

You dig out a mine, gaining a steady supply of a single non-precious material and make an immediate discovery leading away from the mine. You take +1d on this and all future discovery rolls.

*A mineshaft might need mining gear, lots of railway, or several minecarts.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The brakes on the minecart give out and it goes careening back down into the mineshaft. It slams into the wall at the end of the track, knocking it down and revealing an enormous crystal cavern."

#### Testing Chamber

You can empower your monster science, for a price. You can pay cost related to your testing to (choose one): *remove an item's volatility* - *increase a concoction in size, scope, or duration* - *take +1d on your next use with a specific item*.

*A testing chamber might need a huge steel door, a pulley system, or gears.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I haul my chainsaw into the testing chamber and start mixing together
fuels, seeing if I can get a superpowered mix. I manage to do it, but the
chainsaw gets away from me at one point and cuts my helmet in half."

#### Vehicle Bay

The dungeon has an incredible vehicle, such as a submarine, dirigible, or steamcar. Detail the vehicle and give it edges (choose two): *armored* -  camouflaged* - *dependable* - *fast* - *nimble*. Give it a flaw (choose one): *clumsy* - *distinct* - *noisy* - *rickety* - *slow*. The vehicle is fully repaired or rebuilt by imps each recovery.

*A vehicle bay might need parts for the vehicle, barrels of fuel, or awesome paint.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The bay doors open above us and we float up into the sky, the Wicked Ones on deck and a few minion packs dangling from the ropes below us. I guess someone should've told them how fast this thing is."

#### Workshop

You have a well-furnished workshop where your imps and minions can toil away. They take +1d when working on crafting or building projects.

*A workshop might need crafting tools, leather aprons, or barrels of nails.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "A portal opens and the chaos mage steps out. 'Hmm, wrong room... but
this'll do,' he says as he holds open his cloak. Tentacles reach out of it,
lifting the goblin workers into the air."

## Hideout

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Keeping Your Head Low

A Hideout is a place to lay low and keep an eye on the world. Escaping detection is your primary concern. You live and operate under the radar. Teamwork and efficiency are the keys to your success. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Agents of Chaos***: Your dungeon excels at placing blame on others or meddling with faction plans. On a success on blowback, your minions gain morale and you can finish or reset a faction clock. *What happens in the aftermath of your raid to cause this?*

### Hideout Tier 3 Rooms

#### Dojo

The dojo master trains you relentlessly, forging you into a unified team. When you team up, you only take stress on a failure and 6s from different participants count towards rolling a critical. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dojo only needs a master to train you, which you must either defeat or impress.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Complete silence greets the monk and she steps lightly into the room.
Her keen eyes catch two imps at the far end scurrying over and sliding
the doors open. The master steps out and says, 'Finally, a real fight.'"

#### Gambling Den

You set up a small gambling establishment, attracting monsters from outside your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have Trick as their primary action and start with the strapped upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A gambling den might need gambling tables, luxurious lighting, or cigars.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Those two slissiks came in here and fleeced us. I'm pretty sure they're
working together. I definitely want them on our side."

#### Gear Locker

You always get geared up before leaving the dungeon. You gain a supply slot and have a steady supply of the following concoctions and gear: *climbing gear* - *glowsticks* - *smoke bombs* - *tar bombs* - *throwing weapons* - *thunderstones* - *traps*.

*A gear locker might need a trove of concoctions, crates of gear, or matching outfits.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I give the signal to pull out thunderstones, then I kick the door in and get out of the way to let them toss the stones in. Back to the wall as I hear loud bangs, I point at the waiting Brute and give the thumbs up to go."

#### Obstacle Course

Minions train hard here, honing their skills. When recruited, you can add an extra primary action to minions, but only to ***Finesse***, ***Scan***, or ***Skulk***. This room also acts as a trick equal to the dungeon tier, detailed when the room is built.

*An obstacle course might need rolls of wire, large spikes, or barrels of tar.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The adventurers swing over the tar pit, crawl under the barbed wire, and run across the balancing board inches above the lava. They don't even realize that each of them dropped a piece of equipment along the way."

#### Planning Room

You plot out your raids in great detail. You take +1d on engagement rolls for negotiation, stealth, or trickery plans. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

*A planning room might need maps, measuring tools, or refreshments.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Going too deep into my craving, I run out of my stash of unicorn blood. I spend hours and hours meticulously planning out how to get more. I'm at the drawing board so long that my fingers start bleeding."

#### Roost

You have bats, ravens, or other small winged beasts at your service. Each time you plan a raid, the dungeon can establish a fact about the target that your beasts saw from the sky. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A roost might need cages, winged beasts, or pet food.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Our ravens return from the woods, reporting back that the count is back from his hunting trip. One of the horses is injured, so they're slowly leading it back to the village."

#### Tavern

You have a raucous tavern complete with a bar, shelves of alcohol, a roaring fire, and usually a scuffle. Your minions gain morale during recovery and take +1d when fighting invaders here. Wandering monsters also show up from time to time.

*A tavern might need a bartender, lots of alcohol, or a bard.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "As you enter the tavern, you see imps singing tunes and dancing on tables. It's getting pretty crazy in here, but at the bar sits a lone dark dwarf quietly downing flagons of ale."

## Stronghold

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Through Strength of Arms

A Stronghold is the seat of power from which you command your forces. You project might through sheer military power. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Warband***: The dungeon has a raiding party, a shared minion pack with *greater scale* than usual and the *companion* and *expendable* upgrades. It can be sent on its own raids. At the beginning of the raiding phase, each player allocates 1d towards a target, chooses a raid plan, then selects a goal (choose one): *gather room materials* - *grab good loot* - *influence a faction* - *kidnap someone* - *setup for a pillaging raid*. You can also choose the same plan and goal to combine rolls to determine effectiveness. Make a fortune roll for each target, rolling the number of dice allocated and narrate accordingly. If you forego these independent raids, the warband can accompany you on a raid instead.

### Stronghold Tier 3 Rooms

#### Barracks

Fresh recruits flock to your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Smash*** as their primary action and the mindset (loyal) upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A barracks might need a cache of weapons, armor, or a large amount of rations.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I ***Smash*** the biggest one in the face. 'Follow me. There's work to do.'"

#### Bestiary

You have mounts and a secure area to keep them in. Detail them and give them edges (choose two): *aquatic* - *armored* - *fast* - *flying* - *magical* - *terrifying*. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A bestiary might need the mounts, something to feed them, or riding equipment.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I yell to mount up and we head off into the night on our giant bats."

#### Fighting Pit

Place any two combatants in the pit, then each PC chooses the one they think will win. Make fortune rolls for each fighter, with the loser dying and both living on a tie. If your chosen fighter wins, you gain a dark heart.

*A fighting pit might need exotic weapons, dangerous animals, or a pitmaster.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The two dwarves face off against one another, the promise of living another day overriding old friendships. The imps and minions howl at them, making wagers and tossing around gold."

#### Funeral Pyre

Your warrior culture honors the dead, burning their bodies as a sendoff to the afterlife. When minions die in combat, any minions that witness it gain morale and will perform a downtime action during the next downtime without asking for gold.

*A funeral pyre might need incense, special wood, or the tabards of conquered enemies.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I toss the bear head onto the pyre. 'When that dwarf ranger fell, you all saw how enraged that bear got. But these two crazy bastards? They stood in the way, and somehow brought her down with 'em! For glory!'"

#### Smithy

You have a steady supply of mundane weapons such as axes, bows, and hatchets. Your minions take +1d when crafting items or adding edges.

*A smithy might need an anvil, metalworking tools, or a large pile of charcoal.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I head down to the smithy and throw my battleaxe on the table along with a small pile of gold and say, 'Make it look scary as hell.' My minions fight a bit over the gold, then get to work."

#### War Drums

A steady beat emanates throughout your dungeon, keeping everyone focused on the task at hand. Each player can tick a project clock once per downtime, but each tick must go to a different clock. Your imps also take +1d on their downtime action.

*War drums might need lots of leather, huge wooden drums, or massive horns.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The adventurers steel themselves and head in. They hear the low, deep pounding of drums from deep within the tunnel giving them a shiver up their spine."

#### War Room

Proper strategy is the key to warfare. You take +1d on engagement rolls for ambush, assault, or strike raid plans. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

*A war room might need maps, books on warfare, or intel on your enemies.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "As we gather around the table, I slam my fist down. 'Tonight, we take the fort. A full-on assault. It's been a thorn in our side this whole time. Let's just get it over with. Get the minions ready!'"

## Temple

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Serving a Greater Power

A Temple is an unholy monument to a dark god, venerating their domains as you lay out your master plan in accordance with their desires. A temple often utilizes rituals to further its goals. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Unholy Intervention***: Once per cycle, one member of the dungeon can beseech the dungeon’s deity to cast a tier 3 spell from their domains. You roll the dungeon tier as an action roll with no dice penalty and the GM determines who is open to any consequences.

### Temple Tier 3 Rooms

#### Altar

You can make a sacrifice at the altar, paying cost to gain a dark blessing (choose one): *take +1d on a single roll with an item this cycle* - *take +1d on your next resistance roll* - *your next failure instead becomes a mixed*. The sacrifice must be unique each time you ask for a blessing.

*An altar might need incense, statues, or icons specific to your god's domains.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I kneel before the altar and Vahoona answers my howl with her own. Shaking with terror, I pay for the blessing with shock to ***GUTS***."

#### Antechamber

Between the stairway and sanctum on the final level is an impressive room glorifying your deeds in the name of your dark god. Adventurers stop to take note of it, giving you a dark heart and +1d on the engagement roll before a sanctum fight.

*An antechamber might need skulls, the banners of worthy foes, or an artist.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The adventurers creep through the antechamber, horrified by the scenes depicted on its frescoed walls. You can hear their gasps, filling your dark hearts with glee as you prepare for battle."

#### Augury Circle

You can flashback to time spent in the circle, reading portents of future events. You can establish a fact in the present about an NPC's next likely action. *What portent did the circle show you and how does it manifest in the present?*

*An augury circle might need mosaic tiles, a large mirror, or exotic incenses.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Chaotic imagery fills my vision, then Zaheen shows me a portent - a sparrow flying through the madness. In the present, the same sparrow smacks straight into the door and dies, warning me of a guard ambush."

#### Dormitory

Fresh cultists flock to serve your god. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have your god's favored action, chosen when this room is built, as their primary action and start with the *mindset (zealous)* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dormitory might need furniture, accoutrements, or the first batch of pupils.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "It seems like a new clan of scrawny kobolds has felt the pull of Gimosha. I toss a gold’s worth of obsidian daggers on the floor and say, 'Anyone that comes away with a dagger is promoted.'"

#### Reliquary

This room corrupts and amplifies the magic of up to three items of unholy impact placed within it. When an item is placed, it immediately incants a tier 2 ritual causing a persistent effect within your dungeon related to the specific item.

*A reliquary does not require special materials beyond the items placed within it.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I put the holy ring, still on the priest's finger, on the pedestal. The reliquary twists the domains of the fishing village's goddess, filling our underground river with carnivorous fish. It's now an extreme hazard."

#### Penance Chamber

Your minions fear punishment more than death and will never betray you. When they fight to the death, they ignore the dice penalty from being bloodied.

*A penance chamber might need shackles, whips, or tar.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Grabbing the dagger off of her dead friend with the only hand she has left, the cultist staggers to her feet and mutters, 'Death in service.'"

#### Scriptorium

Your deeds are recorded in unholy scripture, immediately giving you wicked xp equal to your dungeon tier. You also gain a new wicked xp trigger: Were your actions worthy of your god’s notice? Each PC must prove their own worth to gain this xp.

*A scriptorium might need desks, writing equipment, or leather for binding.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I finally broke that elven druid, getting some nice hints as to the location of the Mother Tree. I'm sure Melawa is pleased."

## Denizens

Dungeons are full of horrible monstrous life. Some are mere inhabitants that are too mindless or stubborn to obey your orders while others serve you directly and prove their worth many times over. What’s important to remember, though, is that each of these denizens exists to keep greedy adventurers away from your hoard.

There are three basic categories of denizens inhabiting your dungeon:
- **Imps** are weak, pathetic creatures that serve your dungeon in exchange for protection. They allow the players to handwave a lot of the drudgery of tasks in the dungeon as the imps are always working in the background. They have two traits which help inform how they behave and what they look like within scenes. You rarely, if ever, roll to see what the imps are doing, though the GM does roll for them once per downtime.
- **Creatures** are beasts or mindless monsters that take up residence in your dungeon and defend their lairs against invasion, but are not under your direct control. They come with two traits to inform how they battle invaders. You roll their tier as a fortune roll when they do something, which is almost always fighting adventurers in their lairs.
- **Minions** are your servants, doing your bidding. Each PC has control of a pack of minions that serves as their secondary PC. You control them during dungeon defense and can bring them along on raids. They come with actions of their own and act like weaker versions of the Wicked Ones.

### Imps

**Imps** are small, pitiful monsters that flock to your dungeon as soon as you start building it. In exchange for protection, they take care of the drudgery in your dungeon, cleaning, digging, and hauling stuff around. Their existence allows players to handwave a lot of the tedious "management" of the dungeon. Imps can be weaved into scene narration as you see fit.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Each downtime, the GM rolls one downtime action representing the imps effort within the dungeon. They roll the dungeon tier for this.

Exactly what kind of monsters they are is up to you and is chosen at dungeon creation. They usually match the dungeon theme, its overall atmosphere, or the region it's built in. A forge in a volcano might have magma imps while a temple's imps would likely be themed after the god they worship. After you decide what your imps are like, give them two of the following traits or make up your own to help make narrating them in scenes easier:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Cowardly
> - Cruel
> - Manic
> - Noisy
> - Stupid
> - Surly
> - Troublesome

These traits give you some easy hooks for portraying your imps within scenes. Making the imps a part of the story in the dungeon helps bring it to life and gives you something to play off of. Here are some example imps:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Demonic imps (cowardly - stupid). They're always hurting themselves, looking for food, and running from anything bigger than them. These are the typical imps shown throughout this book.
> - Clockwork helpers (clever - noisy). They're always clanking around, needing oiled, and finding overly ingenious solutions to simple problems.
> - An enslaved fairy tribe (manic - troublesome). They're always flittering in your face, pulling on your gear, and tipping over drinks.
> - Small rock elementals (stupid - surly). They're always bickering with
each other, dropping things, and falling apart.

Imps only speak in grunts, squeeks, and gestures, though they can understand the Dark Tongue. They're generally useless, completely refusing to venture outside of your dungeon. They can only have very low impact on any situation, merely adding flavor to scenes like flipping a trap's lever or being thrown at an adventurer. If you ever need to determine an imp’s effectiveness, **they roll 0d and take -effect**.

### Creatures

**Creatures** are mindless or unintelligent monsters or beasts that have chosen to lair in your dungeon. They’re not under your direct control, though they fight off invaders in defense of their lairs. A crafty Wicked One or minion might be able to trick or goad them into doing something for them, though. They're neutral towards other dungeon denizens for the most part, though a bad calamity roll might bring them into conflict with each other. Monsters moving past or through their lairs generally go unimpeded.

Creatures are rated from tier 1 to tier 4, representing how deadly they are. A creature might be a single monster or it could be a group of smaller monsters. When an invader passes by the entrance to their lair or moves through it, the creature engages them and defends its home.

When adventurers pass near a lair's entrance, they're drawn inside. It doesn't matter if they were just moving by the entrance or were going straight through the lair. When adventurers are in the vicinity of a creature, it will seek to defend its lair. **You roll a creature's tier to determine how a fight goes.** Before making the roll, narrate how the creatures move to engage the adventurers.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Creature Rolls
> Roll the creature's tier to determine how it fairs against the adventurers threatening its lair. Creatures slash the hearts of adventurers, seeking to kill them.
>
> **Failure**: The creature is slain or flees the dungeon for good.  
**Mixed**: You damage an adventurer of the GM's choice and the creature is knocked out of the fight.  
**Success**: You damage an adventurer of your choice. Roll again.  
**Critical**: You damage two adventurers of your choice. Roll again.
>
> ❖ You can't damage the same adventurer twice in a row unless they're alone.

When you roll for a creature, you narrate what it looks like as the creature struggles with the adventurers, incorporating their traits and their lair into your description. On a critical or success, the creature attacks them without repercussion and prepares to go in for more. On a mixed, they put up a decent fight but are defeated. They're merely dealt with for now, but still alive within your dungeon and ready again after dungeon defense. On a failure, however, the adventurers slay the creature or drive it off permanently.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Okay, the python is sneaky and powerful so I think it's gonna come at them from above. And... yes! A success! Okay, so it drops right down onto that rogue, digging into her neck and coiling its body around her. As everyone comes running to help, I'll roll again to see what happens."

#### Attracting Creatures

**Creature lairs** attract creatures looking for a home into your dungeon. They're stumbled upon by your imps as your dungeon grows, usually being caves or other natural underground formations which feel appropriate for the type of creature you want. Your hoard or the lair itself provides sustenance for the creature.

[context]: # (important rule)
> When your dungeon tier increases, you add a new creature lair somewhere to your dungeon, choosing its location and drawing it on the map. The new lair only attracts creatures equal to the dungeon tier at which the lair was added, which should be noted on the map when it's drawn.

**When you have a vacant lair, one new creature can be attracted to your dungeon each recovery. This always fills the lowest tier lair first.** However, the very first time you build a lair, it immediately attracts a new creature. You decide what kind of creature is attracted, but it tends to be a good practice to just replace fallen creatures with the same type to reduce bookkeeping. You can also spend gold or take downtime actions to attempt to fill vacant lairs faster if you want.

**When a creature is attracted to your dungeon, one player sets up a short scene detailing it.** This scene could be as simple as noticing the empty lair has been filled again or it could be more complex with other PCs joining in as you all watch a new monster make its way through your tunnels. Remember that creatures are independent, often more like beasts than intelligent monsters, though they're not hostile towards you. Taking the time to recognize that the lair has been filled provides a chance to further flesh out your dungeon and give creatures their space within the story.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I think I'm just wandering down one of these tunnels when I hear something rustling around in that lair. I look in and see a huge basilisk in there settling down for a nap. Looking down the hallway, I see some of our goblin minions dragging a goat to feed it. I kinda think to myself, 'Well, better it eats our goats than our goblins, I guess.'"

Each dungeon begins with a single tier 1 creature lair. They might also be added to your dungeon by discoveries, with the GM deciding the tier, location, and nature of the lair and the first creature inhabitant. The initial lair, the dungeon tier increasing, and discoveries are the only ways creature lairs can be added. If you manage to come into control of a creature besides those gained in the above ways, you can place them within your dungeon but once they're dead, you lose them forever. Additional creature lairs can't be built as your hoard can only support creatures determined by the dungeon tier or specific, self-sufficient lairs that already existed underground that you discovered.

Creatures are generally quite unwilling to venture outside of their lairs. If you do manage to coax a creature out, its effectiveness in whatever you're doing with it is determined by rolling its tier as a fortune roll.

#### Creature Creation

When a creature is attracted to your dungeon, you decide what kind of monster it is. You choose its type, how many of them there are, and give it two traits that help describe the way it behaves. When a new creature lair is built, one player must write it down in the dungeon duties section of their character sheet. They're responsible for narrating that lair's creature or knowing when a new creature is attracted to the dungeon.

A single creature might represent a swarm of insects, a pack of beasts, or some other group. Their total impact is equal to their tier, so the higher the creature's tier, the larger the group or more powerful the individual creature is.

Creatures are unintelligent - natural or magical beasts, undead, fungi, oozes, and the like. After you have chosen the creature, you give it two traits from the following list or make up your own that better describe it:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Corrupted
> - Corrosive
> - Diseased
> - Incorporeal
> - Flaming
> - Freezing
> - Magical
> - Oozing
> - Sneaky
> - Strong
> - Swarming
> - Terrifying
> - Tireless
> - Venomous

Traits give you a hook to pull into the fiction when describing how they face off versus adventurers or cause problems during calamity. Here are some examples:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Basilisk (strong - terrifying)
> - Clockwork warrior (clever - tireless)
> - Ghost (freezing - incorporeal)
> - Giant snapping turtle (sneaky - strong)
> - Giant scorpion (strong - venomous)
> - Lava snake (flaming - strong)
> - Skeletons (corrupted - tireless)
> - Sludge monster (corrosive - oozing)
> - Swarm of bats (terrifying - swarming)
> - Zombie horde (swarming - terrifying)

### Minions

Minions are packs of minor monsters, usually humanoids, that can follow your orders. Each player has one minion slot which they can fill with minions by paying gold to hire them or coercing them to join with a downtime action, going on a raid, or by some other means. Once they're a part of your dungeon, the hoard covers their sustenance and in return, they guard your dungeon halls. The hoard can only support one pack of minions per player. If you pay them a little extra, they even work on downtime projects or accompany you on a raid.

**Minions always come in packs.** They're generally nameless monsters that operate in small groups which you treat as a single entity. They take -effect when separated.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Your minion pack acts as a secondary PC.** You play as them during dungeon defense, scenes inside your dungeon, and when you bring them on raids.

Minions are like weaker versions of Wicked Ones. You make action rolls to determine how effective they are. Here are some key differences:
- Minions have a primary action (2d) and two secondary actions (1d) chosen when you recruit them. They roll 0d on other actions.
- They don't have stress and can't resist.
- They don't gain xp, though you can upgrade them with gold.
- They can be paid 1 gold to perform a downtime action or go with you on a raid.
- They don't take shock, instead getting knocked out of scenes or bloodied when they would otherwise take shock.
- They take -1d to all rolls while bloodied and clear bloodied only on recovery.
- They can almost always avoid being destroyed by exiting a scene without a roll, running away, getting knocked out, or so on.
- They can gain **morale** which you can spend to take +1d on an action or fortune roll. Morale is gained from <ins>calamity rolls</ins>, but the GM can also award minions with morale when there is an outstanding moment in the story or the PCs take specific action to improve it. Minions can only have one morale at a time.

#### Recruiting Minions

You can recruit minions by spending 1 gold or performing a downtime action. Either way, you need a plausible way to get minions to come into your dungeon. Look at the factions around you or talk with the GM to see what other monsters might be on the map to find a good source of minions. When re-recruiting minions, it's sometimes easiest to keep all of the details the same and narrate how you replenish their ranks.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Your vile friend knows a slaver that sells you a pair of ogres.
> - You head to a nearby orc tribe and call in a favor the chief owes you.
> - You raid a kobold village, pressing everyone you can grab into service.

#### Creating Minions

When you recruit minions, you need to answer the following questions to flesh out the minion pack:
- How many are in the pack? (2-5)
- What race are they?
- What job are they filling?
- What's their primary action?
- What are their secondary actions?
- What's their dark impulse?
- Do you want to pay for upgrades?

Minions come in packs and are always members of the same **race**. Establish the **number of minions** in the pack. It might be as few as two powerful monsters, like a pair of ogres, or it might be as many as five smaller creatures. Then, choose a **job** which gives them a strong core concept and identity plus any basic gear they need for that job. Here are some example jobs:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Acolytes
> - Alchemists
> - Builders
> - Cutthroats
> - Envoys
> - Grunts
> - Mages
> - Miners
> - Priests
> - Raiders
> - Scouts
> - Thieves
> - Trappers
> - Tricksters
> - Witches
> - Workers

Next, assign one **primary action** (2d) and two **secondary actions** (1d) to the minions. Their job title is likely to influence this, such as builders having ***Smash*** or ***Tinker*** or scouts having ***Scan*** or ***Skulk***. If you give them ***Invoke***, you must also choose a path of magic that they can cast from. They can only cast tier 1 spells of that path.

Then, give your minions a **dark impulse** likely to pull them away from the tasks you've given them. Minion impulses tend to be substantially more disruptive, troublesome, or petty than Wicked Ones impulses. The GM can look to these impulses when deciding the consequences of action rolls or what trouble your minions might cause during a bad calamity in the dungeon. Here are some examples impulses:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Addicted
> - Aggressive
> - Disloyal
> - Greedy
> - Impatient
> - Lazy
> - Moody
> - Superstitious

You can then add **upgrades** from the list on the next page by spending gold. Finally, minions always gain **morale** when recruited.

#### Upgrades

Upgrades are additional advantages that your minions have. Each upgrade costs 1 gold and you can add them during the lurking phase. This gold represents resources directed from your hoard to recruit higher quality minions or provide them with additional training, equipment, or motivation that improves their usefulness to the dungeon. If your minions are destroyed, you lose any upgrades they had.

- *Adept*: Your minions can cast a single tier 2 spell once per cycle. They take -1d on this as normal, but don't have to pay stress.
- *Equipped*: Your minions gain a defense of your choice from their gear.
- *Expendable*: Your minions don't need to be re-recruited with gold or a downtime action when destroyed. There are always more around, replenishing on recovery, and keep this upgrade when they come back. They cannot have any other upgrades besides those granted by a room or ability.
- *Fluent*: Your minions can speak the Light Tongue, but with a strong accent.
- *Mindset*: Your minions have a mental edge, which might be considered as a circumstance towards position and effect (choose one): *fearless* - *loyal* - *zealous*. You can also make up your own.
- *Strapped*: Your minions have 1 supply slot which can be used to access anything from your supply.
- *Trained*: Your minions take +1d on a specific type of downtime project (choose one): *brew* - *build* - *contact* - *craft* - *incant* - *recruit* - *torture*.
- *Versatile*: Your minions have another primary (2d) and two more secondary
(1d) actions.

*Companion* is a special upgrade only available to minion packs gained through calling abilities. When you first select the ability, they're automatically recruited. They will always join a raid without asking for gold and you can decide what happens to them when they're taken down. Maybe they were merely knocked out, ran away, or were actually killed. This gives them permission to live when other minions might not. They must still be recruited again as usual, including paying for any upgrades you previously bought for them. The gold or downtime action might represent tending their wounds or going out to find them.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Minions are Characters, Too!
> When roleplaying minions, it’s important to remember that they have their own motivations. They're not just an extension of your PC, they're a second character. The pack as a whole has a group personality. Try to lean into this concept and their expendable nature when narrating their actions!

## Dungeon Layout

There’s a lot going on inside of dungeons such as rooms, traps, tunnels, tricks, locks, and lairs. You and your minions build all of these during the lurking phase with downtime projects. You start off with a subterranean cavern or some other entrance from the overworld and branch out, adding on bit by bit as your dungeon extends deeper and deeper into the earth.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Everything in your dungeon must be connected by passages large enough for
most monsters to make their way through. Anytime you build something, you
can connect it to the rest of the dungeon with a short tunnel.

Hidden or smaller passages are fine as auxiliary pathways, but they're certainly not fit for day to day traffic. Any regularly used hidden tunnels are sure to have plenty of tracks that give them away and smaller passages might fit a tiny kobold, but they’ll prove a hindrance to any minions that have to carry something.

Building rooms and crafting traps, tricks, and locks are done as <ins>downtime projects</ins> during the lurking phase. When building, don't sweat the small stuff. There are no exact rules for measurements. Just draw what feels right, looking at the <ins>drawing guide<ins> to get a sense for what feels best.

### Rooms & Structures

Rooms and structures are the backbone of your dungeon, providing space to live, a place to house tricks and traps, and each room's function. While any dungeon can build tier 1 and 2 rooms, tier 3 rooms are specific to your dungeon theme.

#### Tier 1 Rooms and Structures

***Crawlway***: A tiny passage that smaller creatures can move through fairly quickly, but is too tight for day to day laboring within the dungeon.

***Long Tunnel***: A simple, long passage used to connect areas of the dungeon.

***Minor Room***: A simple room built only to please your minions and give your dungeon atmosphere, such as a mess hall, latrines, a skull filled corridor, or a garden. When you build one, all minions gain morale and you take +1d on your next calamity roll. Give it two atmospheric traits (choose two): *bright* - *cold* - *cluttered* - *crumbling* - *dim* - *echoing* - *hot* - *noisy* - *silent* - *smelly* - *spooky*.

***Secret Tunnel***: A hidden passage that will likely go unnoticed unless recently used.
Traverse: A bridge, ladder, rope, swing, pulley lift, or other similar structure that allows safe passage over tough terrain.

***Window***: A hole in a wall between caverns, rooms, or tunnels.

#### Tier 2 Rooms & Structures

***Guard Post***: Assign a single pack of minions to this room. They can always start dungeon defense here regardless of their <ins>starting position roll</ins>.

***Minion Lair***: Assign a single pack of minions to this room. These minions get morale each recovery and take +1d when defending the room against invaders. Give it two atmospheric traits from the minor room list.

***Prison***: A room with 4 cells that can contain prisoners, who can't escape without *opportunity*. If invaders enter the prison, make a fortune roll equal to the dungeon tier to determine whether prisoners can be freed and if they join the invaders.

***Stairway***: Add another level to your dungeon, with the sanctum remaining at the bottom. This stairway connects them.

***Torture Chamber***: You gain +position or +effect (your choice) when <ins>torturing</ins>.

#### Tier 3 Rooms

Each dungeon theme has a set of tier 3 rooms that you can build, but you can also build a single tier 3 room from another dungeon theme's list with your dungeon's flexibility slot. Building a tier 3 room is an 8-segment <ins>downtime project</ins>, though you also have to gain some relevant **materials** to finish off the room. Materials are some supplies that are relevant to that specific room. They almost always require going on a raid to acquire them. The exact nature of what materials a room requires is up to the players and the GM, though each tier 3 room lists a few examples after it.

### Traps

Traps are static, well-hidden defenses that are meant to surprise and maim any unwary adventurer wandering your halls. Each trap consists of a mechanism which details what the trap does and a trigger which details what sets it off. The player in charge of the trap narrates the results of the trap roll. Trap rolls deal damage as if they were ticking a clock, with each tick doing half a heart of damage.

[context]: # (roll summary)

> Roll the trap's tier to determine how effective it is against the invaders that triggered it.
>
> **Failure**: The trap is disabled or avoided by the adventurers.  
**Mixed**: You damage an adventurer of the GM's choice.  
**Success**: You damage an adventurer of your choice. Roll again.  
**Critical**: You damage two adventurers of your choice. Roll again.
>
> ❖ You can't damage the same adventurer twice in a row unless they're alone.

The **mechanism** details how the trap is effective against invaders. Choose from the mechanisms below or make up your own:
 - crushing wall
 - darts
 - spikes
 - fire
 - boulder
 - sawblade
 - pendulum blade
 - gas
 - lightning coil
 - lightning arc
 - swing blade
 - explosive barrel
 - pitfall
 - floor blade

The **trigger** is how the trap is activated. Depending on the nature of the trigger, some adventurers might not even activate it such as a levitating mage not setting off a pressure plate. Choose from the triggers below or make up your own:
 - pressure plate
 - tripwire
 - magical detection
 - illusion or disguise
 - sound
 - item removal
 - false door

Traps are rated from tier 1 to tier 3, based on how deadly they are and chosen by the player when it's crafted. A tier 1 trap is somewhat easy to avoid, such as a doorknob trapped with a poison needle. Tier 2 traps are deadly, like a giant swinging blade attached to a pressure plate. Tier 3 traps are the deadliest, likely to affect multiple adventurers, like a tripwire that releases an enormous rolling stone ball.

### Tricks

Tricks are subtle ways to get adventurers to do what you want or create advantageous situations for your dungeon. They don’t tick adventurer hearts, instead letting you play with the minds of the invaders. Each trick consists of a **method** which details how it fools adventurers, a **trigger** detailing when it activates, and an **intent** which details what happens when it works.

[context]: # (important rule)
> When adventurers encounter a trick, the player in charge of it rolls its tier as a fortune roll and narrates what happens based on the results. The GM can step in to scale the effectiveness up or down to better match the result if needed.

Tricks are rated from tier 1 to tier 3 based on how likely they are to work. The more likely it is to work, the higher its tier is. This is decided by the player when crafting the trick. A trick might be something like the following, with the method and intent listed after each example in parenthesis:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> A string with metal pieces tied across it that jingles when kicked.  
(warning string - move past it - alert all minions to presence)
>
> A pool of water that fools adventurers into leaving heavy armor behind.  
(pool of water - move through it - remove armor)
>
> A tied up prisoner that screams for help, drawing adventurers towards them.  
(tied up prisoner - prisoner hears noise - recklessly follow the sound)
>
> A winding maze that splits up the adventuring party.  
(maze - enter it - split up the party)
>
> A statue that grabs onto them, allowing imps to snatch a potion.  
(statue - look at it - use up an adventurer move)
>
> Moving lights from around a corner that make them snuff torches.  
(lights - enter the hallway - proceed in darkness)
>
> Glowing moss in a cavern that rubs off on adventurers.  
(glowing moss - move through cavern - make adventurers glow)
>
> A dazzling waterfall that distracts adventurers as minions sneak up on them.  
(dazzling waterfall - stop to look - don't watch own back)

A trick can never lead an adventurer into a situation they can't escape from. Once some time has passed, they finally overcome it somehow and move on. These types of tricks buy you time or an advantageous situation, but they’re temporary. Remember that adventurers are incredibly crafty and even if they’re stuck down a pit trap or chained to a wall, given a bit of time, they’re likely to find a way out. You can also never trick an adventurer into leaving your dungeon completely.

### Locks

Locks are used to buy time while defending to set up proper defenses, maneuver around your dungeon, or beat a hasty retreat. They also serve to push adventurers away from sensitive areas. It’s best to remember that locks won’t keep adventurers out forever - given enough time and determination, adventurers can push their way through any lock in front of them. When a lock pushes the invaders away, they go on another path until there are no paths besides the locked one. They then double back and encounter the lock again. Each time they come against the lock, you make a <ins>lock roll</ins>, detailed later in the pathing section. Locks might alert nearby minions, give them time to set up ambushes, or keep sensitive areas safe.

Locks are rated from tier 1 to tier 3 depending on how difficult it is to get through it, with players deciding the tier of the lock when building it. Tier 1 locks are the simplest locks with limited reliability, such as a wooden bar holding a door shut. Tier 2 locks are straightforward and effective at keeping people out, such as a chained door with a padlock. Tier 3 locks are complex and formidable, such as a large steel portcullis with a pulley and password system.

When you build a lock, you first choose what kind of **door material** it is made of. You can choose from those below or make up your own:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - bars
> - bone
> - crystal
> - ice
> - iron
> - magical field
> - roots
> - stone
> - wood

Next, you select what the **lock mechanism** is. Make sure to note these down under dungeon duties and the player who builds them should narrate what happens after the lock roll is made. Below are some examples, or you can think of your own:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - arcane
> - bar
> - bolt
> - heavy object
> - mortise lock
> - padlock
> - password
> - pressure plate
> - pulley
> - puzzle
> - rim lock
> - timed

### Sanctum

The Wicked Ones spend most of their time in the second level of the dungeon, called the sanctum. You don't defend the first level. That's a job below you, meant for your minions, creatures, and defenses. The denizens of your dungeon expect as much. They know that this is their role. For this reason, the Wicked Ones can't leave the sanctum during dungeon defense as doing so would risk upsetting the dungeon hierarchy.

Your sanctum is a large room representing the heart of your dungeon. It houses the lion’s share of your hoard and should reflect the style of leadership the PCs bring to the dungeon. It also makes for a convenient place to entertain and impress other evil entities or conduct rituals.

At the end of your dungeon's first floor, there are stairs leading downwards towards your sanctum. As your dungeon grows, you can reposition these stairs to the new "end" of your dungeon. You can do so during downtime and it does not require a downtime action.

#### The Boss Fight

The sanctum's main purpose is to be the location of the boss fight, the titanic struggle waiting at the end of the dungeon for the adventurers. As they come down the stairway, you roll engagement to set up the scene. **The Wicked Ones can't leave the sanctum and can't interact with the first floor’s dungeon defenses.** Doing so would show immediate weakness to the minions and cause a revolt as your creatures try to wrestle leadership from you and establish the proper dungeon hierarchy. This creates a very clear difference between the first and second level of your dungeon, allowing each to have their own unique scenes within the defense.

#### Private Lairs

The PCs need a place to lay their head, but lairing near the other denizens of the dungeon would make you appear weak. Each PC has their own private lair extending off of the sanctum. This does not need to be drawn on the map. PCs can set scenes within their lairs to flesh them out as important parts of the story or handwave them as just background details.

#### Power Struggles and Raid Plans

The sanctum makes for a convenient location to set most scenes involving power struggles or raid planning. It's meant to be the power center of your dungeon. The more detail you put into it, the more interesting later boss fights become.

## Discoveries

As you dig into the earth, you’re bound to run across other things underground such as rivers, lakes, lava flows, remnants of old structures, and horrible creatures best left buried. When your dungeon tier increases, you make a discovery as your imps find something underground while they clear out space for your dungeon. The GM rolls to find out how beneficial it is for you. Discoveries may come at other times that the GM deems appropriate as well, such as after several new additions have been made to the dungeon or as the result of <ins>calamity</ins>.

[context]: # (important rule)
> When you make a discovery, the GM makes a fortune roll (usually 2d) to see how beneficial or harmful it is for your dungeon, then decides on something appropriate that you found underground. A critical counts as two successes!

| | Discoveries |
|-|-|
| 1 | Earth Formation |
| 2 | Liquid Formation |
| 3 | Forgotten Structure |
| 4 | Resource / Stockpile |
| 5 | Creature / NPC |
| 6 | Magic / Science |

The exact nature of what you find is up to the GM, though they can roll on the table on the right to set the basic category, use the more detailed tables on the next few pages, or come up with something on their own. Discoveries are drawn by the GM and introduce randomness into the dungeon. They tend to come towards the "end" of your dungeon, extending it further into the deep. If a discovery needs to be represented mechanically, such as being a creature, a room, or so on, work with the GM to figure it out when it's discovered.

A **success** should clearly improve the dungeon or make the PCs lives better. They're usually placed in the perfect area to best help out the dungeon.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> This might be a long tunnel leading to a friendly dark faction, a tier 3 room from another dungeon theme, a stash of potions, or a hidden exit to the surface.

A **mixed** should be light in impact, perhaps a little good or bad for the PCs depending on how they respond to it. They're usually placed in areas of slight inconvenience.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> This might be a neutral creature that only attacks if you approach it, an underground river, some abandoned tunnels, or a shared supply of coal.

A **failure** should clearly hurt your dungeon, causing immediate problems for you or making dungeon defense more difficult. They're almost always placed in positions that make it easier for invaders to bypass defenses or interfere with your layout.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> This might be a tunnel full of dwarves mining, a cavern with noxious gas that flows into your dungeon, a cursed trove of magic items, or a giant spider that demands food.

### Types of Discoveries

While discoveries underground can be anything the GM thinks would make for interesting gameplay, the following six categories help imagine what's possible.

- **Earth Formations**: Naturally occurring formations of stone and dirt that are typically found in underground cave systems.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like crystal caverns, winding tunnels, deep holes, and new entrances to your dungeon.

- **Liquid Formations**: Naturally or unnaturally occurring liquid flows and pools.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like rivers, lakes, geysers, ooze, tar pits, or lava.

- **Forgotten Structures**: Ancient remnants of dungeons and underground bastions that you dig up and incorporate into your own dungeon.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like dungeon rooms, bridges, winding corridors, or crypts full of the dead.

- **Resource / Stockpile**: Naturally growing plants or fungus, ores, or goods buried and hidden by others.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like mushroom filled tunnels, a fantastic fishing spot, a vein of iron ore, or buried treasure.

- **Creatures / NPCs**: Wild animals, monstrous beings, and new factions that might be either friendly or hostile towards your dungeon.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like burrowing beasts, a hive of giant bugs, lost adventurers, imprisoned beings, or an underground colony.

- **Magic / Science**: Wild arcane phenomenon, persistent magical effects, or discarded technology left buried or intentionally hidden in the deep.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> These are things like portals, power cores, automatons, or puzzles.

#### Hazards

A hazard is a discovery, such as those above, that is dangerous to both the dungeon denizens and any invaders. They're marked with the symbol to the right on the map. (An exclamation mark) Hazards might be modelled as a trap, a trick, or simply a fortune roll to see what happens when you or the invaders interact with it in some way.

[comment]: # (the symbol to the right is explained in parenthesis next to the sentence mentioning it)

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Use Discoveries to Thwart the Perfect Dungeon
> Discoveries are a great tool for the GM to interfere with the plans of their players. No dungeon is complete without its share of weird tunnels and caverns stemming off of it and connecting to other areas of the dungeon. Mix things up by introducing rivers, lava flows, or large chasms blocking expansion in some direction. Even good discoveries could open up an interesting new cavern, but unfortunately provide an easier passage to sensitive areas.

## Drawing Guide

The dungeon serves as a maze for adventurers to get lost in. Drawing it out will help bring it to life and keep everyone on the same page while setting scenes inside of it. The dungeon is drawn out on the **dungeon sheet**, giving you an easy to use grid to work off of while drawing it.

Drawing the dungeon works best if everyone gets involved and takes turns drawing. You don’t have to be an artist. Just drawing out simple squares and circles is enough. Having everyone get involved makes the dungeon feel like it belongs to everyone and makes for a more interesting, chaotic dungeon as you’ll have multiple minds at work in the planning. If there’s no quick volunteer to draw a new addition, the GM should just point to someone to draw it.

**Drawing the dungeon is meant to be fun.** It doesn't have to be a masterpiece and shouldn't really be about drawing skill. It just needs to get the point across. However, if a player doesn't enjoy drawing, they can ask another player to draw for them! Getting pushed way outside of your creative comfort zone isn't fun at all.

This drawing guide is broken up into two drawing styles: **basic** and **detailed**. The actual drawing guides can be found over the next few pages, but the styles and their merits are discussed below. You're not required to follow either of these guides, of course! They're just there to help give you some ideas.

The **basic drawing style** makes sure that almost anyone can draw the dungeon. It consists of straight lines, simple shapes, and dots which represent all of the important, required mechanics of the dungeon. It provides a visually clean dungeon which is easy to understand at a glance.

This style works very well if you then add details by making notes around each area. If a dungeon room is full of old boxes, making a note of that helps you remember it during play!

The **detailed drawing style** delves into making your dungeon more visually interesting. You can follow the guide to decorate the dungeon, adding objects and clutter to areas that can then later be pulled into scenes taking place in those areas.

Having a visual reminder of what might be around you is a huge help when roleplaying as your PCs or minions. The more detail you can add to the dungeon, the more interesting the stories inside it become.

### Tips to Drawing Better Dungeons

- Tier is the most important piece of information about creatures, traps, tricks, and locks. No matter which style you choose to use, always note down the tier by writing a number of dots equal to the tier near the drawing.
- Dungeon rooms tend to be geometric shapes, looking like someone built them. Most discoveries drawn by the GM and many creature lairs have a natural look to them, such as the walls of a cavern or an old structure that has partially collapsed.
- Most dungeon rooms are between 3x3 and 5x5 squares in size. There's no strict rule on this, but this size tends to make for a balanced dungeon with plenty of space on the paper. The tunnels connecting them are generally 1 to 3 squares in length. Discoveries can be any size that the GM feels is appropriate. **All rooms must be connected to the dungeon by tunnels.**
- The sanctum is larger, usually 5x5 or more squares in size. Don't forget to draw a stairway connecting it to the first level as well. Adding details to your sanctum makes boss fights more interesting.
- Minions are not drawn on the map, since they move around the entire dungeon a lot. Imps are not generally drawn either, though sketching out some of them can be a nice reminder of their existence.
- Creatures should be drawn on the map. When drawing in the basic style, you should fill in the circle with the first letter of the creature to help remember what it is.
- When you draw a trick, it's usually just best to draw a trigger or some symbol representing it. Arrows that indicate intent also help you remember them.
- Keep in mind that your dungeon will grow over time away from the edge of
the dungeon sheet that it started on.

## Dungeon Defense

You’ve raided the overworld for its riches, used the hoard you’ve amassed to attract minions, built locks and traps to withstand invasion, and now it’s time to put it all to the test and keep those pesky adventurers away from your gold.

Invasions usually occur due to bad <ins>blowback</ins> or <ins>calamity</ins> rolls as your actions in the overworld bring adventurers down upon you or problems within your dungeon alert them to your presence. Sometimes, events in the story might dictate an invasion is occurring, such as a faction clock filling or you giving away your dungeon's location to known enemies. They're generally undertaken by groups of adventurers coming to deal with the threat you pose to the region and plunder your hoard. At times, the adventurers may instead bring along a few hirelings to fill their ranks or the group invading your halls could be something else entirely, such as a hostile orc tribe, a huge mob of angry townsfolk, a powerful ghost, or a garrison from the local lord.

Dungeons are in hidden, isolated, or wild areas. The exact location of your dungeon is usually unknown to those on the surface. Most adventurers that wander into your halls are just following some rumors of monster activity in the area and head out in hopes of finding it and ridding the world of your evil.

### Invasion

When invaders enter your dungeon, they're usually <ins>adventurers</ins>. Each adventurer has **hearts** that represent their willingness or ability to push forward. Dungeon defenses roll to damage these hearts, wearing away at the resolve or health of the invaders. When a defense works, it slashes these hearts. One slash is equivalent to a clock tick and two slashes takes out a heart. When adventurers have no more hearts, they're killed, knocked out, or run away.

Adventurers are incredibly strong foes and, when grouped, the only way to stop them is to send them through the gauntlet that is your dungeon’s defenses. Adventurers might use their moves to disable or resist dungeon defenses. A move might completely negate the dungeon defense, such as a scout spotting a trap or a barbarian bashing down a locked door. At other times, it might merely reduce the effectiveness of the defense, dropping its tier by one or two. These are judgement calls by the GM. Adventurers' passives might also interact with dungeon defenses, such as a rogue reducing all locks in a dungeon by -1d.

Sometimes, adventurers will bring along **hirelings** to pad their numbers. A hireling has 1 heart and either has a passive or can make a single move. The GM may also choose to have other groups invade your dungeon halls and represent them with hearts, moves, and passives similar to adventurers or use clocks to show how difficult they are to overcome.

#### Types of Invasions

There are two types of invasions, minor and major, usually determined by whether a blowback or calamity roll was a mixed or a failure.

A **minor invasion** happens as a result of minor blowback or calamity. It's an invasion that your dungeon is likely to be able to take care of easily. It’s one or two adventurers wandering into your halls, maybe with a hireling or two tagging along. It might also be a few monsters that come sniffing around instead. Minor invasions act as good tests for your dungeon defenses and easy sources of loot.

A **major invasion** is an existential threat to your dungeon and happen as a result of major blowback or calamity. A powerful group of adventurers, usually equal in number to the PCs, come into your dungeon looking to rid the world of your foul presence. Major invasions are tracked by the GM and escalate in challenge over time.

**Every major invasion is tougher than the last.** Your dungeon tier sets the minimum tier of adventurer that will step foot into your dungeon, but there is no maximum tier. Each time there's a major invasion, a tougher group of adventurers comes after you. This is all tracked on the <ins>GM sheet</ins>.

Most invasions consist of 3 to 5 adventurers, usually the same number as there are PCs. The GM can send more for a harder invasion or swap out adventurers for hirelings to make it a little lighter. Adventurers can also be of different tiers.

When an invasion occurs, the GM selects some adventurers from the <ins>Gamemaster chapter</ins> to send at you or makes up their own. These adventurers might be connected to previous factions that you've tangled with, but also might just be randomly questing in your area and stumble upon your dungeon.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The townsfolk gather together enough coin to hire the adventuring party at the tavern, telling them that you've been raiding the town for months. The adventurers search for a few hirelings to act as meat shields, then head off in search of your dungeon."

[context]: # (example of play)
> "A wandering group of adventurers, barely more than brigands really, make camp in the cave entrance to your dungeon. It takes them a while to notice the dungeon's locked door, but when they do, they get the bright idea that they should go in and check it out."

[context]: # (example of play)
> "The duke sends out a call for help, having been unable to handle your raids on his own. The greatest adventurers in the land gather and swear to the duke that they will rid the world of your foul presence, also looking forward to the rich reward he offers."

### Starting Locations

When an invasion occurs, the Wicked Ones are always located in the sanctum where they await the adventurers for the final boss battle. **Wicked Ones can't leave the sanctum during dungeon defense.** Whether they're even aware of the invasion occurring above them is determined by an engagement roll when the adventurers reach the end of the first level. Such worries are below the leaders of a dungeon and the reason that you hire minions and build defenses in the first place. When an invasion occurs, you need to figure out where the minions start off.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Starting Locations**: You make a 1d roll for your minion pack to determine its starting location, narrating what you're doing when the invasion occurs.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Ah, I rolled a mixed. I think my kobold scouts are going to be in
their minion lair, but incredibly hungover. Their dark impulse is
addicted after all."

Once you make the roll, it's up to you to decide where your minions start off based on the roll's results. Remember that minions are also affected by the repeated defenses rule, suffering -1d if the invaders face the same defense in a row, so it's a good idea to spread them out throughout the dungeon.

- A **success** starts you off in a good position. You begin in the exact dungeon room you want to be in with weapons nearby. You might be:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - In your lair, setting up an ambush for when they arrive.
> - Hiding behind a statue, waiting for an adventurer to trigger a trap.
> - Carrying one of your master's concoctions to them as you hear footsteps coming from outside.
- A **mixed** starts you off in a less than ideal situation. You might not have weapons or maybe just not begin in a great location. You're likely busy doing some other task. You might be:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Carrying boxes near your dungeon entrance where you spot the adventurers, but you left your weapons in the factory.
> - Working on digging out a room, pickaxes in hand, but unaware an invasion is occurring.
> - Patrolling the halls, perhaps even hearing something out of the ordinary, but not in a very good location.
- A **failure** starts you off in a terrible position. You're far from the action, rather distracted by something you're doing, likely without weapons, or maybe even sleeping. The adventurers have a decisive advantage against you. You might be:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Facing off against each other in the fighting pit as the imps cheer.
> - Laying in a hallway, asleep after a huge meal.
> - Carefully moving across the small bridge over the magma river.

### Minion Awareness

Dungeons are strange places and sounds travel in odd ways. Uneven cave walls cause strange echoes or even absorb sound. Smoother walls send sound funneling down hallways, but it can be next to impossible to discern where the sounds came from. Doors might even block sounds entirely, especially reinforced locked ones. If there are underground streams or lava flows, the constant background noise might swallow up the sounds of conflict.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Minions can't act on player knowledge until they become aware of invaders. They only become aware when invaders enter rooms directly adjacent to them or they are alerted by some other means. Once alerted, they can act.

Monsters tend to be a noisy bunch, filling the dungeons with the sounds of their work, revelry, bickering, and fighting. Sudden, violent clashes between dungeon denizens are commonplace. Digging sounds echo throughout the halls of the dungeon. The sounds of an imp screaming while a creature gobbles them down barely registers to minions. The clanging of metal as doors and traps are created or used is heard regularly. Such sounds hardly stand out to minions as unusual.

On top of this, adventurers usually try to move quietly, knowing the danger of alerting their enemies. Crafty adventurers might even use a move to set up traps, luring nearby minions to their demise or sending them off in the wrong direction.

Once your minions are alerted, you're free to act with them as you wish. You can now act on any information that you as a player have, even if the minions do not know it themselves. Don't get too wrapped up in who knows what - focus on setting up cool scenes and putting adventurer heads on spikes.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Why Can't Wicked Ones Leave the Sanctum?
> The Wicked Ones being restricted to the sanctum reinforces classic fantasy hack and slash dungeon themes surrounding minions and their masters. Dungeon logic dictates that masters wait deep within their dungeons, letting their minions and other defenses do the hard work. The Wicked Ones are far too busy with their own nefarious plots to concern themselves with the first level of the dungeon. And even if they did venture forth and try to save their minions, they would upset the dungeon hierarchy, likely triggering rebellion by showing their weakness. The first floor of the dungeon is the time for all of your defenses to shine! Focus on that and enjoy all of the hard work you’ve put into the dungeon.

### Pathing

The GM controls the movement of the invaders through the dungeon. Generally, they enter through the dungeon's entrance and work their way through the dungeon towards the sanctum. However, invaders may have other motivations, or come in through other means. They could tunnel in through the side or maybe teleport in, though this is the exception rather than the norm.

As the invaders move through the dungeon, the GM narrates their movements. The invaders should feel skilled and their progress invasive. They're formidable foes coming after your hoard and wrecking your home. When there are multiple paths that the invaders can take, pathing is determined by a fortune roll.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Pathing**: When there's a fork in the path, ask the players which way they want the adventurers to go and make a 1d fortune roll. On a mixed or success, they go the way the players want them to. On a failure, they go the other way.

When <ins>locks</ins> stand in the way of adventurers, you make a lock roll. This may repel the adventurers, sending them down other paths. Inevitably, adventurers will scour your dungeon, retreading paths and coming up against locked doors until they eventually overcome them. Tricks, traps, and locks can slow them down but only getting rid of all of their hearts can fully repel them. Otherwise, they keep pushing and testing your locks, eventually breaking through even if they have no moves remaining. They inevitably make their way towards your sanctum.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Lock Rolls
> Roll the lock’s tier, which decides whether the adventurers get past the door or sends them down another path.
>
> **Failure**: They unlock the door and move past it.  
**Mixed**: They go another way unless they have no other option.  
**Success**: An adventurer wastes a move trying to open it, then they go another way unless they have no other option.  
**Critical**: Each adventurer wastes a move trying to open it, then they
go another way unless they have no other option.
>
> ❖ When there is no other way forward, roll again for the lock.

When the invaders come close to creatures, traps, or tricks, they activate. If they're roughly in the same room as a defense and haven't made specific efforts to avoid them, it activates the defense. Adventurers are also pulled into creature lairs.

When invaders first travel through a tier 3 room, they loot it, boosting their spirits. **Each adventurer recovers a heart slash when they leave the tier 3 room.** However, if the room itself is a trap or a creature, they only recover the heart slash on a failure.

### Dungeon Defense Narration

The players are responsible for rolling for and narrating the dungeon's defenses, keeping in mind how the GM has narrated the adventurers moving through the dungeon. In this way, the dungeon feels like it belongs to you, not the GM. It's your home that you've put in the effort to build, so enjoy telling the story of how the defense plays out. Below are some examples of the form that narration might take, with examples for each roll result showing how the narrative bends to match the dice roll.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> ***TRAP***: The adventurers activate a swinging blade / pressure plate trap.
> - **Failure**: "The knight steps on the plate and the blade comes swinging down. He pivots and catches it on their shield, deflecting it away."
> - **Mixed**: "The knight tries to catch it on his shield and prevents most of the damage, but the force smacks them in the face with the shield."
> - **Success**: "The illusionist rushes forward past the knight, wanting to see what's ahead. Suddenly, they hear a "click." and the blade comes down, digging itself into their shoulder."
> - **Critical**: "The illusionist rushes forward, barely missing the pressure plate. Halfway down the hall, they turn and tell the buccaneer to hurry up! It's the buccaneer that activates the trap, sending the swinging blade into both of them."

[context]: # (list of examples)
> ***TRICK***: The adventurers hear a tied up prisoner screaming for help.
> - **Failure**: "The adventurers stop and listen, then give each other a solemn look. They know that man is already dead. They continue on the other path."
> - **Mixed**: "They catch the sound and run towards it, responding more quickly than the minions planning an ambush. They actually reach the prisoner and untie them. The prisoner becomes a hireling, joining them. But now, the minotaur grunts charge from behind."
> - **Success**: "They run towards the voice as fast as they can, completely unaware of the minotaur grunts about to ram them from a hallway they're about to pass."
> - **Critical**: "The party argues, but the amazon thinks she knows that voice! It's her uncle. She takes off running, leaving her friends behind, and walks right into a minotaur axe swinging in from the side tunnel."

[context]: # (list of examples)
> ***LOCK***: The adventurers come across an ice door / puzzle lock.
> - **Failure**: "The alchemist holds a torch up to the door, melting it in three specific spots. The ice cracks and falls to the floor in shards."
> - **Mixed**: "The alchemist keeps trying to move the torch around to different spots, but can't quite figure out the problem. The barbarian grabs their shoulder and tells them to move on."
> - **Success**: "The alchemist gets frustrated at the lock, throws aside their torch, and pulls out a firebomb. They launch it at the door. There's a big explosion, cloud, smoke, confusion - and then nothing. The door still stands. The party looks for another route."
> - **Critical**: "As the smoke from the alchemist's bomb clears, the barbarian runs and throws all their strength into it. The door doesn't budge. The cleric convenes with their god, asking for a way through. After several moments of prayer, they walk over and try pulling the handle. It doesn't move. Finally, the chaos mage steps forward and opens their cloak. They hear ominous rumblings and look at each other confidently, thinking it's going to work. Just then, several shimmering butterflies float out of the cloak. The chaos mage shrugs sheepishly and moves down another tunnel."

[context]: # (list of examples)
> ***CREATURE***: The adventurers come across some terrifying/sneaky
gargoyles lining the upper wall of a long, tall room.
> - **Failure**: "The adventurers notice the statues lining the upper walls as gargoyles immediately. The gargoyles spring to life, but the archer peppers them with arrows."
> - **Mixed**: "The archer manages to bring down most of them, but the barbarian in front still gets slashed across their face by one as it flies out of the room and runs away."
> - **Success**: "They move through the room without noticing them. A creepy vibe hangs in the air, but the archer lets out a sigh of relief as they almost reach the other end. Suddenly, black claws grab them and haul them up in the air, flying around above the adventuring party."
> - **Critical**: "Two gargoyles are flying around with the archer, carrying them by their arms. They divebomb the group and throw the archer straight into the monk. The gargoyles fly back up into the shadowed ceiling and disappear. The adventurers form a back-to-back circle in the center of the room and wait for the second wave."

### Sanctum Battle

When the adventurers reach the stairway down, they prepare to push on and face their final battle versus the Wicked Ones. They know a big fight is coming and they head down the stairway prepared. But are the Wicked Ones ready for them? Engaged in their own nefarious doings, do they even know what has happened in the level above them?

[context]: # (important rule)
> The GM rolls engagement as soon as the adventurers reach the stairway. The engagement roll depends on how quickly the adventurers pushed through the dungeon, with longer meaning a better engagement roll for you.

The engagement roll sets the stage for the battle in the sanctum, determining the initial position the PCs find themselves in. After the roll, rewind a bit and the players narrate what their PCs were doing while the first floor was being cleared. If the engagement roll was a failure, the adventurers probably bust in on you while you're distracted in the middle of a scene. If it was a critical, you knew they were coming all along and the adventurers might walk right into your perfectly laid trap.

### Loot the Bodies

Once you manage to stave off the invasion, fighting them off in the sanctum if it's necessary, it’s time to rifle through the adventurers' possessions, dispose of the bodies, or deal with any prisoners. Depending on how an adventurer lost their last heart, you might be able to take them as a prisoner, though this usually requires a bit of forethought on the part of the players. More often than not, adventurers don't live through the traps, minions, creatures, and sanctum fight. When in doubt, the GM makes the call.

If an invasion occured as the result of blowback, you add the loot dice from the invasion to your loot from the raiding phase. If it was the result of calamity, you instead make a second loot roll.

[context]: # (important rule)
> You take +1d to the roll for each adventurer that invaded your dungeon. If the invaders were not adventurers, the GM determines the size of the loot roll.

### Destruction

Sometimes you don't make it through. Perhaps the adventurers busted in your
front door, smashed through your defenses, left your bodies littered around your sanctum, and made off with your hoard. So how do you move on from this?

Maybe you don’t - that could be the end of the game. Dungeons have a way of finding themselves cleaned out. That’s what adventurers do after all. Part of the fun of building a dungeon is knowing the end is coming and seeing how long you can live in spite of that.

## Kill the Trespassers

Having braved the twisted landscape surrounding the PCs' Enclave dungeon, a monk, a templar, and an inquisitor descend inside, looking to retrieve the abbey's missing books and put an end to the evil emanating from the forest.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: Crag, your minions died on the last raid, so we don't need a roll from you. Slem, Ulrot, make a starting location roll for your minions.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I don't need to roll, either. My orc raiders start out in the guard post.
>
> **Slem rolls 1d starting location and gets a success!**
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: My goblin thieves were near the entrance and hear the adventurers coming, so they run back down the hallway past the "patrol" trick. They'll wait in ambush and hope it goes off.
>
> **GM**: Sounds good. Okay, these three come creeping into your dungeon. The monk's face is all scratched up from the thorns in the forest. They're hit by the earthy, mossy smell of the floors and walls as the firefly lamps cast dim yellow light through the halls. The templar accidentally steps on a mushroom imp, squishing it, sending the other imps fleeing in panic. Crag, let's see how the trap in this room goes.
>
> **Crag rolls 1d trap (magical detection - gas) and gets a success!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: The dead, hollowed out tree on the far end of the room opens its eyes and spots the monk stumbling away as the mushroom imps run around their feet. With a groan, the tree opens its maw and spews poisonous fungal gases, catching the monk in the cloud. And I roll again...
>
> **Crag rolls 1d trap again and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: The inquisitor sees the tree moving and jumps to push the monk out of the way, getting caught by the fumes as well. That's 2 slashes for the monk and 1 for the inquisitor. Its poisonous gases spent, the tree just glares at the adventurers as they move on. Do you want them to go down the hallway or through the cave tunnel?
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Definitely down through the cave, towards the gators.
>
> **The GM rolls 1d pathfinding and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: Cool, they enter the cave tunnel. The fetid water on the floor slowly gets deeper as the tunnel expands into the gators' lair. Ulrot?
>
> **Ulrot rolls 1d creature (sneaky - powerful) and gets a failure!**
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: The gators make their move, slowly sneaking up behind the inquisitor, but she knows they're coming and turns around quickly, confusing them. The templar steps in from the side and crushes one of their skulls with his mace, which sends the other one running away.
>
> **GM**: Alright, the adventurers make it to the other side of the cave. Sitting on land, they dry off. Slem, this activates the "patrol" trick now. It's a tier 2 trick, but this inquisitor's passive is that she's really good at figuring out tricks. Let's reduce that to a tier 1.
>
> **Slem rolls 1d trick ("patrol" - snuff torches) and gets a success!**
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Hah! Only needed 1d. So, the adventurers spot some light moving towards them from around the corner. The monk tosses his torch into the water to keep from being seen. The adventurers can't see it, but the "patrol" is just some mushroom imps carrying a big jar of fireflies.
>
> **GM**: As the imps disappear down another hallway, the templar signals to move into the dark hallway. Where are your goblin thieves at?
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: They're hiding behind some rocks just outside the cave. They toss the mushroom imps a thumbs up, then wait as the adventurers pass. They ***Skulk*** and hit them from behind. I'm gonna spend their morale here, too. Can I target that monk? He's hurting the most.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, I don't see why not... the goblins don't really know he's hurting, but you can always act on knowledge the player has. These goblins are perfectly set up for the first strike - <ins>dominant</ins> position.
>
> **Slem rolls 3d Skulk (2d + 1d) and gets a critical!**
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: The monk was the last one into the hallway. He only has a heart and a half left and can't use a move to resist this because it's a crit, so he's dead! One of the goblins climbs up and wraps some rope around his throat while the other two pin cushion him with daggers. For the bonus from the crit, can the other two adventurers not even notice he's gone?
