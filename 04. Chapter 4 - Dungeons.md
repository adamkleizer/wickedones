## Dungeon Overview

Your dungeon is at the heart of your group. It’s your refuge, a place to plan your dastardly deeds, a strong defense against invaders, and a secure location to store your hoard. This section is an overview of how the dungeon works to keep in mind and refer back to while you read through the rules in this chapter.

Your group first chooses a **dungeon theme** together. This gives you a theme around which to base your characters and the campaign. Each theme also comes with a **core feature**, a strong ability related to the theme, and a list of **tier 3 rooms** that you can build within your dungeon to gain strong bonuses, though you have to acquire **materials** for them by raiding. The available **tier 1** and **tier 2 rooms** are the same for each dungeon theme. They give more general bonuses and don't require materials.

You start by finding a location for the dungeon, usually a place that needs its current inhabitants cleared out. After you have a location, you get out the **dungeon sheet**, a grid used for mapping out the dungeon together. You decide on some basic details for your dungeon such as what the floors are made of and what the lighting is like. The GM then draws the outside of the dungeon and any small caves or tunnels already existing in the location. They then roll for a discovery, something you happen across during your initial excavation. The players then draw the dungeon, taking turns picking from a list of dungeon features and drawing them out. Sometime during this process, the GM adds the discovery they rolled earlier to the map. In this way, both the GM and each player have some influence on the dungeon's layout.

You work together to choose a **master plan**, or at least detail the first steps of a plan that develops over time through play. Each plan always starts out the same, though - gathering a hoard. You gain wicked xp when you work towards each step. Over time, the final plan emerges from these steps and gives your group a goal to strive towards.

To grow in power, you increase your **hoard** by raiding the overworld. Your dungeon tier is based on the size of your hoard, ranging from tier 0 to tier 4. The hoard grows when you launch a successful **pillaging raid** against a target higher tier than your dungeon. This is a major looting raid, large enough to increase your dungeon in power. As your hoard grows, it attracts imps, creatures, and minions, as well as paying for their servitude and sustenance.

**Imps** are tiny, weak beings attracted to your dungeon looking for protection in return for basic services. They have a few descriptive traits that help you describe their presence in scenes, but they're mostly background elements that exist to handwave a lot of the minutiae of running the dungeon. Your imps also make one downtime action roll per lurking phase, chosen and rolled by the GM.

**Creatures** are unintelligent or independent powerful denizens of your dungeon that fill **lairs** that open up as your dungeon expands. These lairs function as a home for the creatures, drawing them in. Creatures don't directly serve you, though they're usually not hostile towards dungeon denizens and will fight any adventurers that wander by.

**Minions** are your direct servants, hired or recruited to do your bidding. They have enough intelligence to follow orders. Each player controls one pack of minions which acts as a secondary PC. They're detailed on your character sheet, and have their own actions. You can pay gold to upgrade them, have them perform downtime actions, or join you on raids.

**Adventurers** or other forces intent on your destruction occasionally wander into your dungeon looking to rid the world of your evil or to just get their greedy hands on your hoard. They might show up as a result of a bad blowback or calamity roll, when a faction clock dealing with your dungeon fills, or when the GM just feels like adventurers should show up. Because of this constant threat of invasion, your dungeon needs some security. You can build **traps** to try and kill them, **tricks** to manipulate their behavior, and **locks** to protect sensitive areas, pushing them towards other paths.

The dungeon is split into two levels. The first level connects directly to the overworld through the dungeon entrance and houses the majority of the dungeon, including all of your minions, creatures, rooms, and defenses. At the end of the first level is a staircase leading down to the second level. As your dungeon grows, you move the staircase to the new "end" of the first level, allowing it to grow over time. The staircase leads to the **sanctum**, where the Wicked Ones spend their time and where the hoard resides. The sanctum sets the stage for the final boss battle at the end of a dungeon invasion.

**Discoveries** are natural caves, tunnels, old buried structures, or mystical phenomenon that you find while digging underground. They might be helpful, harmful, or completely neutral depending on how the roll goes. You make a new discovery every time your dungeon tier increases. They're drawn by the GM and give some level of control over how the dungeon develops, letting them introduce chaos into your well-laid dungeon plans.

When adventurers enter your dungeon, your minions are scattered throughout the dungeon. You make a **starting location roll** to determine where they are. They might start out in just the right spot or be completely unaware an invasion is happening. As the adventurers move through your dungeon, you narrate how all of the traps, tricks, and locks try to repel the adventurers, how the creatures fair in defending their lairs, and how your minions stand between the adventurers and your sanctum. During this first level of dungeon defense, you take on the roll of your minions running around the dungeon trying to stop the adventurers.

The Wicked Ones, like any good dungeon boss, are unaware of what's going on upstairs. That's why they built all those traps in the first place. If the adventurers manage to make it through the first level, the GM rolls engagement to determine how the final climactic battle starts off as the adventurers descend into the sanctum.

## Dungeon Creation

You work together as a group to decide all of the details of the dungeon you will live in, then actually draw it out on the dungeon sheet. It grows over time, with the initial setup setting the stage for that growth and serving as a tutorial of sorts to introduce all of the different elements of running the dungeon. The dungeon creation process below gives the essentials of what needs covered to begin play. To make this process easier, the <ins>Starting a Campaign</ins> section integrates dungeon creation smoothly into the first few sessions of the campaign.

### 1. Choose a Dungeon Theme (PG. 176 - 185)

Choose a <ins>dungeon theme</ins>, making sure everyone agrees about what type of dungeon you want to build together and what its <ins>master plan</ins> might be. The dungeon theme also provides you with a list of rooms that you can build and you start off play with its **core feature**, a special benefit that the nature of your dungeon provides you with.

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Enclave
> - Forge
> - Hideout
> - Stronghold
> - Temple

### 2. Set the Dungeon Atmosphere

Answer the following questions to provide some details about what your dungeon is like and note them down on the dungeon sheet. Set up scenes and use power struggles to help make decisions when there are a few good options out there.

- **ENTRANCE: What does the dungeon’s entrance look like from the outside?**  
*It might be something like a natural cave with a stream flowing through it, a small hole in a sewer tunnel, the ruins of an abandoned church, or the trunk of an old, rotten tree.*
- **STRUCTURE: What are the floors and walls made of?**  
*They might be something like cold stone that's slightly damp to the touch, mud intertwined with roots, slick and warm black obsidian, or musty bricks stacked haphazardly.*
- **LIGHTING: What lights the dungeon and how dark is it?**  
*It might be something like torches in sconces lining the walls, magma flowing through the hallways, a magical illumination that clings to the ceiling, or glowing mushrooms growing in every room.*
- **ATMOSPHERICS: What sounds and smells greet those who enter?**  
*It might be something like fetid swamp water, overwhelming incense, rotting flesh, or sulfur and brimstone.*
- **HOARD: What makes up the piles of treasure in your hoard?**  
*It might be something like scattered coins and glowing crystals, stacks of weapons and armor, piles of junk and artifacts, or chests brimming with gold.*

### 3. Choose Your Imps (Pg. 187)

Soon after you clear out your dungeon location and set its atmosphere, <ins>imps</ins> begin to show up. The exact nature and personalities of your imps is up to you. Choose two of the traits below or make up your own to describe them:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Cowardly
> - Cruel
> - Manic
> - Noisy
> - Stupid
> - Surly
> - Troublesome

### 4. Build the Initial Dungeon

The players take turns drawing out the dungeon on the dungeon sheet, or you can choose one person to draw and have players give them directions. Having a conversation about drawing style prior to beginning is a good idea. Later in this chapter is a <ins>drawing guide</ins> with example dungeons to help.

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Drawing the Dungeon (Process)
> 1. **The GM draws the outside area**, the entrance leading in from at least one side of the dungeon sheet. This is usually a cliff face or small cave.
> 2. **The GM rolls a discovery**, but can draw it at any point during this process.
> 3. **The players take turns drawing.** A new dungeon has one of each of the features below. Players go around the table clockwise choosing and drawing a feature from the list until everything has been drawn. Some features are best discussed as a group before deciding.

[context]: # (complete list)
> > - Tier 1 Room
> > - Tier 2 Room
> > - Tier 3 Room (Missing Materials)
> > - Tier 1 Creature Lair
> > - Tier 1 Lock
> > - Tier 1 Trap
> > - Tier 1 Trick
> > - Sanctum
> 4. **Draw the stairway** leading down from the first floor to the sanctum. Then draw the stairway leading up to the first floor from the sanctum.
>> 5. **Name your dungeon.** Each player writes down an idea for a dungeon name. When finished, show the names and discuss. If you can't decide on a good one, the GM can initiate a power struggle to make the decision.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Making Decisions Can Be Difficult
> Some players are more decisive in making decisions than others. That's natural. It's the GM's job to help make everyone at the table comfortable, giving players some room to consider things when it's their turn to decide something, and finally pushing them gently towards landing on a choice. Some players might hesitate, but, it's a good practice to build an expectation that each player participates in the decision making process, but you can also give players an out and just let them pass when they hit a wall.

## Dungeon Features

While there are many types of dungeons out there, dungeons built by the Wicked Ones have a number of aspects in common. They're new dungeons, not built on old ruins, and are unique in many ways. They're built to grow rapidly and mainly serve as a base of operations from which to launch raids and a safe haven from any trouble you stir up when doing so.

Every dungeon has two levels. The first level houses all of your minions, rooms, traps, locks, and so on. This is the buffer layer between you and the surface and its primary purposes is to take the brunt of any adventurer assault on your dungeon. At the end of this layer is a stairway leading down to the second level where your sanctum lies. This is where the Wicked Ones wait to face off against any adventurers who make it through the dungeon's defenses.

As you lay out the dungeon's defenses, the element of surprise is key. If adventurers come up against similar defenses, such as multiple traps in a row, they're going to be on high alert which reduces the effectiveness of that defense type.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Repeated Defenses**: Dungeon defenses take -1d on any rolls if a similar defense was the last thing the invaders encountered. Minions, creatures, traps, tricks, and locks are all affected by this.

### Hoard & Tier

Your dungeon is rated from tier 0 to tier 4, representing its power relative to other factions and invading adventurers. You start off at tier 0 and the tier is tied directly to the hoard, which is all of the gold, treasure, food, materials, and resources you’ve dragged into your dungeon from the overworld. The hoard draws in creatures to serve you and as it grows, so too does your dungeon’s power.

**The dungeon's tier represents training and equipment.** The GM compares the dungeon's tier to an adventurer's or other enemy's tier when judging if they're more powerful than the Wicked Ones or the dungeon's denizens. This is a circumstance that counts towards position and effect.

**The dungeon's tier represents raiding power.** The GM compares the dungeon's tier to a faction's tier to determine if the target you're raiding has an advantage against you. These advantages might be things like better equipment or training, larger numbers, or more powerful magic. As your dungeon grows more powerful, you can raid targets belonging to more powerful factions.

When facing tougher enemies, you might start an encounter with a lower engagement roll or even with consequences already inflicted. You might have difficulty overcoming challenges as your effect is limited or face greater risks as you find yourself in over your head. The opposite is also true, though. When facing weaker enemies, you enjoy a decisive advantage over them.

#### Increasing Dungeon Tier

You grow your hoard by launching a <ins>pillaging raid</ins> against a target belonging to a faction at least 1 tier higher than your current dungeon tier. If successful, your dungeon’s tier increases during the next <ins>recovery</ins> and the target's faction tier drops by one. The hoard can only grow by taking wealth from a more powerful faction, proving that you have the power to belong in the new tier. When your tier increases, it has the following effects:
- **New Discovery**: Imps dig deep into the earth, leading to a <ins>discovery</ins>.
- **New Creature Lair**: Add a <ins>creature lair</ins> equal to your dungeon tier and detail
the creature that inhabits it.
- **More Imps**: Imps roll the dungeon tier for their <ins>downtime action</ins>.
- **Power Growth**: The power of PCs and the dungeon denizens grow, used to
compare against raid targets and adventurers.

#### Losing the Hoard

You could lose your hoard in a few ways, though it's pretty rare to lose hoard without the entire dungeon falling. A bad calamity roll might push minions to riot and make off with part of your hoard. Adventurers could bust into your sanctum, take you down, and flee with part of it. An enormous dragon could demand part of your hoard when you try to strike a deal with them. When you lose hoard, you don't lose the benefits of your tier but must reclaim or replace what was taken.

### Dungeon Duties

The dungeon is a complex beast and each player has to take an active role in running it. On each character sheet is a place to list your dungeon duties, those parts of the dungeon that you alone are responsible for. When something is added to the dungeon that must be taken care of, narrated, or rolled for in some way, it's added to a player's sheet and they're responsible for bringing it into the game. If one player ends up with too many dungeon duties, you can spread these out to other players, even if they didn't work on that part of the dungeon.

Locks, creatures, traps, and tricks are always added to this list. Dungeon rooms or discoveries might need to be as well. Even certain types of decision making or drawing can be added to the list if your group decides to delegate those tasks instead of working on them together.

### Master Plan

Every dungeon has a master plan, a purpose for existing. You work together to choose a plan that aligns well with your theme, the characters you’re playing, and the <ins>sandbox</ins> you’ve set up. In this way, you can determine together what you want the game to be about and be rewarded for playing towards those goals.

[context]: # (important rule)
> You earn 1 wicked xp in each session that you work towards the steps in your master plan. This is a group trigger, so either all PCs get it or nobody does.

Your first step is simple - **grow the hoard**. Setting up initial rooms, hiring minions, and eventually pillaging a higher tier target all work towards this first fundamental step. Once that step is completed and you're tier 1, you establish the next step in your plan. You don't need to decide on what the final step is until it becomes clearer later through play. Your PCs might have known the plan all along, but the players can figure it out as you go along. You only need to know what the next step is.

Each step should be broad enough to take 2 or 3 sessions to accomplish, usually needing a couple of raids. If a step becomes meaningless, is too narrow, or you lose focus on it, you can mark it off and write in another one instead.

[context]: # (example of play)
> #### Corrupt the Woodlands Forever
> - **Step 1**: *Grow the hoard.*
> - **Step 2**: *Clear the northern woods of foresters and loggers.*
> - **Step 3**: *Unite the monster tribes of the forest.*
> - **Step 4**: *Wage war on the fae and bring down the dryad queen.*
> - **Step 5**: *Break the queen and reveal the location of the forest heart.*

> - **Step 5**: *Spread disease amongst the castle defenders.*
> - **Final Step**: *Introduce the now chaotic region to Melkahar, the god of pestilence and decay.*

### Dungeon Themes

Every dungeon is built around a central theme, chosen together as a group before the dungeon is built. The theme gives you a **core feature** related to the nature of the dungeon and a set of tier 3 rooms that you can build within it. Each dungeon also has a **flexibility slot** which you can use to build a tier 3 room from another theme.

The theme keeps players all on the same page thematically, allowing you to design characters that fit in well with the theme or fill a unique niche, as well as choosing steps in your master plan that go along with the theme. The choice of dungeon theme is a statement about what kind of things the players want to do in the game. You can choose from the following themes and their tier 3 rooms:

- **Enclave**: Tapping Into the Arcane. Choose this dungeon theme if you want your dungeon to be mystical from top to bottom. Its core function is ***twisted landscape***, corrupting the area surrounding your dungeon. An Enclave has the following tier 3 rooms: ***academy***, ***crucible***,  **greenery***, ***library***, ***potion lab***, ***scrying pool***, and ***spawning chamber***.
- **Forge**: The Power of Industry. Choose this dungeon theme if you want a dungeon full of monstrous inventions and steampunk tech. Its core function is ***power source***, boosting the productivity and defenses of your dungeon. A Forge has the following tier 3 rooms: ***alchemist lab***, ***guild hall***, ***factory***, ***mineshaft***, ***testing chamber***, ***vehicle bay***, and ***workshop***.
- **Hideout**: Keeping Your Head Low. Choose this dungeon theme if you want to work as a cohesive unit and manipulate the factions of the region. Its core function is ***agents of chaos***, allowing you to strongly influence faction clocks. A Hideout has the following tier 3 rooms: ***dojo***, ***gambling den***, ***gear locker***, ***obstacle course***, ***planning room***, ***roost***, and ***tavern***.
- **Stronghold**: Through Strength of Arms. Choose this dungeon theme if you want to face challenges with pure military might. Its core function is ***warband***, giving you a powerful minion that can raid the region. A Stronghold has the following tier 3 rooms: ***barracks***, ***bestiary***, ***fighting pit***, ***funeral pyre***, ***smithy***, ***war drums***, and ***war room***.
- **Temple**: Serving a Greater Power. Choose this if you want to focus on a certain god and its domains. Its core function is ***divine intervention***, which you can use to cast a tier 3 spell from your god. A temple has the following tier 3 rooms: ***altar***, ***antechamber***, ***augury circle***, ***dormitory***, ***reliquary***, ***penance chamber***, ***scriptorium***.

[context]: # (important rule)
> The room descriptions on the following pages refer to *you* or *the dungeon*.
> - <ins>You</ins> means the room bonus applies to each PC individually.
> - <ins>The dungeon</ins> means it applies once to the group of PCs as a whole.

## Enclave

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Tapping into the Arcane

An Enclave is infused with magic. Arcane energy lingers in the air, runes are scrawled on the walls, and even the lowliest of minions may have some level of magical aptitude. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Twisted Landscape***: Arcane energy corrupts the area around the dungeon. Establish its range, increasing with tier, and how it manifests (choose 3): *corrupted wildlife* - *dark whispers* - *illusions* - *inclement weather* - *living plants* - *wisps*. These act as a trap and a trick equal to the dungeon tier against invaders.

### Enclave Tier 3 Rooms

#### Academy

Young monsters come to study and learn arcane secrets. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Invoke*** as their primary action and the *adept* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*An academy might need crystal balls, mantles, or wands.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I walk in to see a mishmash of young monsters slaving away at the spell memorization they've been assigned. I spot a group of lazy goblins hanging out in the back, avoiding their work. They're perfect for the job.”

#### Crucible

The mystical power of this room enchants items. Each downtime, it can either produce a single tier 1 magic item or tick a magic item creation clock twice. You must still provide the special requirements for tier 2 and 3 magic items.

*A crucible might need an essence core, a mystical beast, or magical helpers.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “One of your kobolds runs up to you holding a dwarf skull. Excitedly, she puts it on like a helmet. When she speaks, the skull's mouth moves and it sounds like the dead dwarf's voice!"

#### Greenery

This garden of voracious plants will devour living prey. Feed them to harvest (choose one): *a plant-based shared supply* - *special ingredients for potions*, *a few doses of a concoction*. The higher the tier, the better the harvest. This room is also a trap equal to your dungeon tier.

*A greenery might need rare plants, fertilizer, or artificial sunlight.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “We drag the scout into the room and toss him onto the floor. The plants wake up and turn to look at him, baring their teeth. Later in the day, I return to pick some of the fruit they've grown.”

#### Library

Books are the key to knowledge of the world. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about the history, cultures, or arcana of the world. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A library might need a trove of books, large bookshelves, or a librarian.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I leaf through some old dusty tomes, looking up the duke's lineage and find out that his succession was illegitimate. The true heir is still alive."

#### Potion Lab

Your imps have learned how to make potions. The dungeon chooses a single magic path of which you have a steady supply of all tier 1 potions and a single tier 2 potion.

*A potion lab might need brewing equipment, special ingredients, or a giant cauldron.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The slissiks knock over a shelf full of Spiderlegs potions, dumping them on the adventurers. Let's see how they react to growing spider legs!"

#### Scrying Pool
The pool reveals far away scenes. Once per cycle, the dungeon can establish a fact about an NPC’s recent activity. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon. *What question or object do you present to the pool to guide its gaze?*

*A scrying pool might need cursed water, mosaic tiles, or a center figurine.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I toss the insignia into the pool and ask, 'Where's the captain now?' As the ripples settle, it shows me a clear image of the captain riding with a few men. I recognize the area instantly. 'He's on the south road. Let's go.'”

#### Spawning Chamber

Minions are grown or summoned here, easily replacing your losses. Once per dungeon defense, a copy of a slain minion pack can burst forth from this spawning chamber. You can also add the *expendable* upgrade to minions for free.

*A spawning chamber might need mystical goo, glass containers, or magic seeds.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “My orc grunts rip themselves out of the ooze sacks they were growing in. They follow their instincts, grabbing an axe off the wall and heading down the tunnel towards the adventurers.”

## Forge

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> The Power of Industry

A Forge is built for production - inventions, factories, steamworks, and alchemy can be found throughout the complex. Problems are approached with ingenuity, eagerness, and a keen disregard for danger. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Power Source***: In a forge, your sanctum is a source of power fueling your dungeon, such as a volcano, a steamworks, or a waterwheel. During downtime, you can take +1d on a single downtime action. During dungeon defense, you can take +1d on a single lock, trap, or trick on your list of dungeon duties.

### Forge Tier 3 Rooms

#### Alchemist Lab

Your imps are always hard at work mixing reagents. You have a steady supply of all tier 1 concoctions.

*An alchemist lab might need alchemy equipment, chests full of reagents, or recipes.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “KABOOM! An explosion in the lab showers a minion pack with beastlure and broken glowsticks falling off the shelves. From down the hall outside, you hear the sniffing of wargs.”

#### Guild Hall

You let your minions organize to better their working and living conditions. In truth, you ignore their demands, but the illusion of having some control reduces grumbling. The dungeon takes +1d on calamity rolls.

*A guild hall might need benches, a long table, or scribing tools.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Your minions are sitting in the guild hall having a guild meeting. You see one of the kobold alchemists pounding a gavel, calling the meeting to order. Then suddenly, BAM - the door is kicked in by adventurers.”

#### Factory

Your imps relentlessly sweat away in the factory. Each downtime, they can either produce a single tier 1 contraption or tick a contraption clock twice.

*A factory might need metal casing for a boiler, piles of coal, or raw iron.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I wake up heavily hungover, lying on a table. I turn my head to see machinery and tools tossed about, the result of my drunken rampage. The imps are all scowling at me. I guess they can't work this downtime."

#### Mineshaft

You dig out a mine, gaining a steady supply of a single non-precious material and make an immediate discovery leading away from the mine. You take +1d on this and all future discovery rolls.

*A mineshaft might need mining gear, lots of railway, or several minecarts.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The brakes on the minecart give out and it goes careening back down into the mineshaft. It slams into the wall at the end of the track, knocking it down and revealing an enormous crystal cavern.”

#### Testing Chamber

You can empower your monster science, for a price. You can pay cost related to your testing to (choose one): *remove an item's volatility* - *increase a concoction in size, scope, or duration* - *take +1d on your next use with a specific item*.

*A testing chamber might need a huge steel door, a pulley system, or gears.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I haul my chainsaw into the testing chamber and start mixing together
fuels, seeing if I can get a superpowered mix. I manage to do it, but the
chainsaw gets away from me at one point and cuts my helmet in half.”

#### Vehicle Bay

The dungeon has an incredible vehicle, such as a submarine, dirigible, or steamcar. Detail the vehicle and give it edges (choose two): *armored* -  camouflaged* - *dependable* - *fast* - *nimble*. Give it a flaw (choose one): *clumsy* - *distinct* - *noisy* - *rickety* - *slow*. The vehicle is fully repaired or rebuilt by imps each recovery.

*A vehicle bay might need parts for the vehicle, barrels of fuel, or awesome paint.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The bay doors open above us and we float up into the sky, the Wicked Ones on deck and a few minion packs dangling from the ropes below us. I guess someone should've told them how fast this thing is.”

#### Workshop

You have a well-furnished workshop where your imps and minions can toil away. They take +1d when working on crafting or building projects.

*A workshop might need crafting tools, leather aprons, or barrels of nails.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “A portal opens and the chaos mage steps out. 'Hmm, wrong room... but
this'll do,' he says as he holds open his cloak. Tentacles reach out of it,
lifting the goblin workers into the air.”

## Hideout

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Keeping Your Head Low

A Hideout is a place to lay low and keep an eye on the world. Escaping detection is your primary concern. You live and operate under the radar. Teamwork and efficiency are the keys to your success. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Agents of Chaos***: Your dungeon excels at placing blame on others or meddling with faction plans. On a success on blowback, your minions gain morale and you can finish or reset a faction clock. *What happens in the aftermath of your raid to cause this?*

### Hideout Tier 3 Rooms

#### Dojo

The dojo master trains you relentlessly, forging you into a unified team. When you team up, you only take stress on a failure and 6s from different participants count towards rolling a critical. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dojo only needs a master to train you, which you must either defeat or impress.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Complete silence greets the monk and she steps lightly into the room.
Her keen eyes catch two imps at the far end scurrying over and sliding
the doors open. The master steps out and says, 'Finally, a real fight.'”

#### Gambling Den

You set up a small gambling establishment, attracting monsters from outside your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have Trick as their primary action and start with the strapped upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A gambling den might need gambling tables, luxurious lighting, or cigars.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Those two slissiks came in here and fleeced us. I'm pretty sure they're
working together. I definitely want them on our side.”

#### Gear Locker

You always get geared up before leaving the dungeon. You gain a supply slot and have a steady supply of the following concoctions and gear: *climbing gear* - *glowsticks* - *smoke bombs* - *tar bombs* - *throwing weapons* - *thunderstones* - *traps*.

*A gear locker might need a trove of concoctions, crates of gear, or matching outfits.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I give the signal to pull out thunderstones, then I kick the door in and get out of the way to let them toss the stones in. Back to the wall as I hear loud bangs, I point at the waiting Brute and give the thumbs up to go."

#### Obstacle Course

Minions train hard here, honing their skills. When recruited, you can add an extra primary action to minions, but only to ***Finesse***, ***Scan***, or ***Skulk***. This room also acts as a trick equal to the dungeon tier, detailed when the room is built.

*An obstacle course might need rolls of wire, large spikes, or barrels of tar.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The adventurers swing over the tar pit, crawl under the barbed wire, and run across the balancing board inches above the lava. They don't even realize that each of them dropped a piece of equipment along the way."

#### Planning Room

You plot out your raids in great detail. You take +1d on engagement rolls for negotiation, stealth, or trickery plans. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

*A planning room might need maps, measuring tools, or refreshments.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Going too deep into my craving, I run out of my stash of unicorn blood. I spend hours and hours meticulously planning out how to get more. I'm at the drawing board so long that my fingers start bleeding."

#### Roost

You have bats, ravens, or other small winged beasts at your service. Each time you plan a raid, the dungeon can establish a fact about the target that your beasts saw from the sky. You can also flashback to use this again while outside the dungeon.

*A roost might need cages, winged beasts, or pet food.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Our ravens return from the woods, reporting back that the count is back from his hunting trip. One of the horses is injured, so they're slowly leading it back to the village.”

#### Tavern

You have a raucous tavern complete with a bar, shelves of alcohol, a roaring fire, and usually a scuffle. Your minions gain morale during recovery and take +1d when fighting invaders here. Wandering monsters also show up from time to time.

*A tavern might need a bartender, lots of alcohol, or a bard.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “As you enter the tavern, you see imps singing tunes and dancing on tables. It's getting pretty crazy in here, but at the bar sits a lone dark dwarf quietly downing flagons of ale.”

## Stronghold

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Through Strength of Arms

A Stronghold is the seat of power from which you command your forces. You project might through sheer military power. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Warband***: The dungeon has a raiding party, a shared minion pack with *greater scale* than usual and the *companion* and *expendable* upgrades. It can be sent on its own raids. At the beginning of the raiding phase, each player allocates 1d towards a target, chooses a raid plan, then selects a goal (choose one): *gather room materials* - *grab good loot* - *influence a faction* - *kidnap someone* - *setup for a pillaging raid*. You can also choose the same plan and goal to combine rolls to determine effectiveness. Make a fortune roll for each target, rolling the number of dice allocated and narrate accordingly. If you forego these independent raids, the warband can accompany you on a raid instead.

### Stronghold Tier 3 Rooms

#### Barracks

Fresh recruits flock to your dungeon. You can recruit minions from this room. They have ***Smash*** as their primary action and the mindset (loyal) upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A barracks might need a cache of weapons, armor, or a large amount of rations.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I ***Smash*** the biggest one in the face. 'Follow me. There's work to do.'”

#### Bestiary

You have mounts and a secure area to keep them in. Detail them and give them edges (choose two): *aquatic* - *armored* - *fast* - *flying* - *magical* - *terrifying*. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A bestiary might need the mounts, something to feed them, or riding equipment.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I yell to mount up and we head off into the night on our giant bats.”

#### Fighting Pit

Place any two combatants in the pit, then each PC chooses the one they think will win. Make fortune rolls for each fighter, with the loser dying and both living on a tie. If your chosen fighter wins, you gain a dark heart.

*A fighting pit might need exotic weapons, dangerous animals, or a pitmaster.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The two dwarves face off against one another, the promise of living another day overriding old friendships. The imps and minions howl at them, making wagers and tossing around gold.”

#### Funeral Pyre

Your warrior culture honors the dead, burning their bodies as a sendoff to the afterlife. When minions die in combat, any minions that witness it gain morale and will perform a downtime action during the next downtime without asking for gold.

*A funeral pyre might need incense, special wood, or the tabards of conquered enemies.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I toss the bear head onto the pyre. 'When that dwarf ranger fell, you all saw how enraged that bear got. But these two crazy bastards? They stood in the way, and somehow brought her down with 'em! For glory!'”

#### Smithy

You have a steady supply of mundane weapons such as axes, bows, and hatchets. Your minions take +1d when crafting items or adding edges.

*A smithy might need an anvil, metalworking tools, or a large pile of charcoal.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I head down to the smithy and throw my battleaxe on the table along with a small pile of gold and say, 'Make it look scary as hell.' My minions fight a bit over the gold, then get to work.”

#### War Drums

A steady beat emanates throughout your dungeon, keeping everyone focused on the task at hand. Each player can tick a project clock once per downtime, but each tick must go to a different clock. Your imps also take +1d on their downtime action.

*War drums might need lots of leather, huge wooden drums, or massive horns.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The adventurers steel themselves and head in. They hear the low, deep pounding of drums from deep within the tunnel giving them a shiver up their spine.”

#### War Room

Proper strategy is the key to warfare. You take +1d on engagement rolls for ambush, assault, or strike raid plans. On a success, you gain a dark heart.

*A war room might need maps, books on warfare, or intel on your enemies.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “As we gather around the table, I slam my fist down. 'Tonight, we take the fort. A full-on assault. It's been a thorn in our side this whole time. Let's just get it over with. Get the minions ready!'”

## Temple

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Serving a Greater Power

A Temple is an unholy monument to a dark god, venerating their domains as you lay out your master plan in accordance with their desires. A temple often utilizes rituals to further its goals. You start with this **core function**:

[context]: # (important rule)
> ***Unholy Intervention***: Once per cycle, one member of the dungeon can beseech the dungeon’s deity to cast a tier 3 spell from their domains. You roll the dungeon tier as an action roll with no dice penalty and the GM determines who is open to any consequences.

### Temple Tier 3 Rooms

#### Altar

You can make a sacrifice at the altar, paying cost to gain a dark blessing (choose one): *take +1d on a single roll with an item this cycle* - *take +1d on your next resistance roll* - *your next failure instead becomes a mixed*. The sacrifice must be unique each time you ask for a blessing.

*An altar might need incense, statues, or icons specific to your god's domains.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I kneel before the altar and Vahoona answers my howl with her own. Shaking with terror, I pay for the blessing with shock to GUTS.”

#### Antechamber

Between the stairway and sanctum on the final level is an impressive room glorifying your deeds in the name of your dark god. Adventurers stop to take note of it, giving you a dark heart and +1d on the engagement roll before a sanctum fight.

*An antechamber might need skulls, the banners of worthy foes, or an artist.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “The adventurers creep through the antechamber, horrified by the scenes depicted on its frescoed walls. You can hear their gasps, filling your dark hearts with glee as you prepare for battle.”

#### Augury Circle

You can flashback to time spent in the circle, reading portents of future events. You can establish a fact in the present about an NPC's next likely action. *What portent did the circle show you and how does it manifest in the present?*

*An augury circle might need mosaic tiles, a large mirror, or exotic incenses.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Chaotic imagery fills my vision, then Zaheen shows me a portent - a sparrow flying through the madness. In the present, the same sparrow smacks straight into the door and dies, warning me of a guard ambush."

#### Dormitory

Fresh cultists flock to serve your god. You can recruit minions from this room. They always have your god's favored action, chosen when this room is built, as their primary action and start with the *mindset (zealous)* upgrade for free. This room also acts as a creature with a tier equal to the dungeon tier.

*A dormitory might need furniture, accoutrements, or the first batch of pupils.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “It seems like a new clan of scrawny kobolds has felt the pull of Gimosha. I toss a gold’s worth of obsidian daggers on the floor and say, 'Anyone that comes away with a dagger is promoted.'"

#### Reliquary

This room corrupts and amplifies the magic of up to three items of unholy impact placed within it. When an item is placed, it immediately incants a tier 2 ritual causing a persistent effect within your dungeon related to the specific item.

*A reliquary does not require special materials beyond the items placed within it.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I put the holy ring, still on the priest's finger, on the pedestal. The reliquary twists the domains of the fishing village's goddess, filling our underground river with carnivorous fish. It's now an extreme hazard."

#### Penance Chamber

Your minions fear punishment more than death and will never betray you. When they fight to the death, they ignore the dice penalty from being bloodied.

*A penance chamber might need shackles, whips, or tar.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “Grabbing the dagger off of her dead friend with the only hand she has left, the cultist staggers to her feet and mutters, 'Death in service.'”

#### Scriptorium

Your deeds are recorded in unholy scripture, immediately giving you wicked xp equal to your dungeon tier. You also gain a new wicked xp trigger: Were your actions worthy of your god’s notice? Each PC must prove their own worth to gain this xp.

*A scriptorium might need desks, writing equipment, or leather for binding.*

[context]: # (example of play)
> “I finally broke that elven druid, getting some nice hints as to the location of the Mother Tree. I'm sure Melawa is pleased."

## Denizens

Dungeons are full of horrible monstrous life. Some are mere inhabitants that are too mindless or stubborn to obey your orders while others serve you directly and prove their worth many times over. What’s important to remember, though, is that each of these denizens exists to keep greedy adventurers away from your hoard.

There are three basic categories of denizens inhabiting your dungeon:
- **Imps** are weak, pathetic creatures that serve your dungeon in exchange for protection. They allow the players to handwave a lot of the drudgery of tasks in the dungeon as the imps are always working in the background. They have two traits which help inform how they behave and what they look like within scenes. You rarely, if ever, roll to see what the imps are doing, though the GM does roll for them once per downtime.
- **Creatures** are beasts or mindless monsters that take up residence in your dungeon and defend their lairs against invasion, but are not under your direct control. They come with two traits to inform how they battle invaders. You roll their tier as a fortune roll when they do something, which is almost always fighting adventurers in their lairs.
- **Minions** are your servants, doing your bidding. Each PC has control of a pack of minions that serves as their secondary PC. You control them during dungeon defense and can bring them along on raids. They come with actions of their own and act like weaker versions of the Wicked Ones.

### Imps

**Imps** are small, pitiful monsters that flock to your dungeon as soon as you start building it. In exchange for protection, they take care of the drudgery in your dungeon, cleaning, digging, and hauling stuff around. Their existence allows players to handwave a lot of the tedious "management" of the dungeon. Imps can be weaved into scene narration as you see fit.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Each downtime, the GM rolls one downtime action representing the imps effort within the dungeon. They roll the dungeon tier for this.

Exactly what kind of monsters they are is up to you and is chosen at dungeon creation. They usually match the dungeon theme, its overall atmosphere, or the region it's built in. A forge in a volcano might have magma imps while a temple's imps would likely be themed after the god they worship. After you decide what your imps are like, give them two of the following traits or make up your own to help make narrating them in scenes easier:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Cowardly
> - Cruel
> - Manic
> - Noisy
> - Stupid
> - Surly
> - Troublesome

These traits give you some easy hooks for portraying your imps within scenes. Making the imps a part of the story in the dungeon helps bring it to life and gives you something to play off of. Here are some example imps:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Demonic imps (cowardly - stupid). They're always hurting themselves, looking for food, and running from anything bigger than them. These are the typical imps shown throughout this book.
> - Clockwork helpers (clever - noisy). They're always clanking around, needing oiled, and finding overly ingenious solutions to simple problems.
> - An enslaved fairy tribe (manic - troublesome). They're always flittering in your face, pulling on your gear, and tipping over drinks.
> - Small rock elementals (stupid - surly). They're always bickering with
each other, dropping things, and falling apart.

Imps only speak in grunts, squeeks, and gestures, though they can understand the Dark Tongue. They're generally useless, completely refusing to venture outside of your dungeon. They can only have very low impact on any situation, merely adding flavor to scenes like flipping a trap's lever or being thrown at an adventurer. If you ever need to determine an imp’s effectiveness, **they roll 0d and take -effect**.

### Creatures

**Creatures** are mindless or unintelligent monsters or beasts that have chosen to lair in your dungeon. They’re not under your direct control, though they fight off invaders in defense of their lairs. A crafty Wicked One or minion might be able to trick or goad them into doing something for them, though. They're neutral towards other dungeon denizens for the most part, though a bad calamity roll might bring them into conflict with each other. Monsters moving past or through their lairs generally go unimpeded.

Creatures are rated from tier 1 to tier 4, representing how deadly they are. A creature might be a single monster or it could be a group of smaller monsters. When an invader passes by the entrance to their lair or moves through it, the creature engages them and defends its home.

When adventurers pass near a lair's entrance, they're drawn inside. It doesn't matter if they were just moving by the entrance or were going straight through the lair. When adventurers are in the vicinity of a creature, it will seek to defend its lair. **You roll a creature's tier to determine how a fight goes.** Before making the roll, narrate how the creatures move to engage the adventurers.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> #### Creature Rolls
> Roll the creature's tier to determine how it fairs against the adventurers threatening its lair. Creatures slash the hearts of adventurers, seeking to kill them.  
**Failure**: The creature is slain or flees the dungeon for good.  
**Mixed**: You damage an adventurer of the GM's choice and the creature is knocked out of the fight.  
**Success**: You damage an adventurer of your choice. Roll again.  
**Critical**: You damage two adventurers of your choice. Roll again.  
❖ You can't damage the same adventurer twice in a row unless they're alone.

When you roll for a creature, you narrate what it looks like as the creature struggles with the adventurers, incorporating their traits and their lair into your description. On a critical or success, the creature attacks them without repercussion and prepares to go in for more. On a mixed, they put up a decent fight but are defeated. They're merely dealt with for now, but still alive within your dungeon and ready again after dungeon defense. On a failure, however, the adventurers slay the creature or drive it off permanently.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "Okay, the python is sneaky and powerful so I think it's gonna come at them from above. And... yes! A success! Okay, so it drops right down onto that rogue, digging into her neck and coiling its body around her. As everyone comes running to help, I'll roll again to see what happens."

#### Attracting Creatures

**Creature lairs** attract creatures looking for a home into your dungeon. They're stumbled upon by your imps as your dungeon grows, usually being caves or other natural underground formations which feel appropriate for the type of creature you want. Your hoard or the lair itself provides sustenance for the creature.

[context]: # (important rule)
> When your dungeon tier increases, you add a new creature lair somewhere to your dungeon, choosing its location and drawing it on the map. The new lair only attracts creatures equal to the dungeon tier at which the lair was added, which should be noted on the map when it's drawn.

**When you have a vacant lair, one new creature can be attracted to your dungeon each recovery. This always fills the lowest tier lair first.** However, the very first time you build a lair, it immediately attracts a new creature. You decide what kind of creature is attracted, but it tends to be a good practice to just replace fallen creatures with the same type to reduce bookkeeping. You can also spend gold or take downtime actions to attempt to fill vacant lairs faster if you want.

**When a creature is attracted to your dungeon, one player sets up a short scene detailing it.** This scene could be as simple as noticing the empty lair has been filled again or it could be more complex with other PCs joining in as you all watch a new monster make its way through your tunnels. Remember that creatures are independent, often more like beasts than intelligent monsters, though they're not hostile towards you. Taking the time to recognize that the lair has been filled provides a chance to further flesh out your dungeon and give creatures their space within the story.

[context]: # (example of play)
> "I think I'm just wandering down one of these tunnels when I hear something rustling around in that lair. I look in and see a huge basilisk in there settling down for a nap. Looking down the hallway, I see some of our goblin minions dragging a goat to feed it. I kinda think to myself, 'Well, better it eats our goats than our goblins, I guess.'"

Each dungeon begins with a single tier 1 creature lair. They might also be added to your dungeon by discoveries, with the GM deciding the tier, location, and nature of the lair and the first creature inhabitant. The initial lair, the dungeon tier increasing, and discoveries are the only ways creature lairs can be added. If you manage to come into control of a creature besides those gained in the above ways, you can place them within your dungeon but once they're dead, you lose them forever. Additional creature lairs can't be built as your hoard can only support creatures determined by the dungeon tier or specific, self-sufficient lairs that already existed underground that you discovered.

Creatures are generally quite unwilling to venture outside of their lairs. If you do manage to coax a creature out, its effectiveness in whatever you're doing with it is determined by rolling its tier as a fortune roll.

#### Creature Creation

When a creature is attracted to your dungeon, you decide what kind of monster it is. You choose its type, how many of them there are, and give it two traits that help describe the way it behaves. When a new creature lair is built, one player must write it down in the dungeon duties section of their character sheet. They're responsible for narrating that lair's creature or knowing when a new creature is attracted to the dungeon.

A single creature might represent a swarm of insects, a pack of beasts, or some other group. Their total impact is equal to their tier, so the higher the creature's tier, the larger the group or more powerful the individual creature is.

Creatures are unintelligent - natural or magical beasts, undead, fungi, oozes, and the like. After you have chosen the creature, you give it two traits from the following list or make up your own that better describe it:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Clever
> - Corrupted
> - Corrosive
> - Diseased
> - Incorporeal
> - Flaming
> - Freezing
> - Magical
> - Oozing
> - Sneaky
> - Strong
> - Swarming
> - Terrifying
> - Tireless
> - Venomous

Traits give you a hook to pull into the fiction when describing how they face off versus adventurers or cause problems during calamity. Here are some examples:

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Basilisk (strong - terrifying)
> - Clockwork warrior (clever - tireless)
> - Ghost (freezing - incorporeal)
> - Giant snapping turtle (sneaky - strong)
> - Giant scorpion (strong - venomous)
> - Lava snake (flaming - strong)
> - Skeletons (corrupted - tireless)
> - Sludge monster (corrosive - oozing)
> - Swarm of bats (terrifying - swarming)
> - Zombie horde (swarming - terrifying)

### Minions

Minions are packs of minor monsters, usually humanoids, that can follow your orders. Each player has one minion slot which they can fill with minions by paying gold to hire them or coercing them to join with a downtime action, going on a raid, or by some other means. Once they're a part of your dungeon, the hoard covers their sustenance and in return, they guard your dungeon halls. The hoard can only support one pack of minions per player. If you pay them a little extra, they even work on downtime projects or accompany you on a raid.

**Minions always come in packs.** They're generally nameless monsters that operate in small groups which you treat as a single entity. They take -effect when separated.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Your minion pack acts as a secondary PC.** You play as them during dungeon defense, scenes inside your dungeon, and when you bring them on raids.

Minions are like weaker versions of Wicked Ones. You make action rolls to determine how effective they are. Here are some key differences:
- Minions have a primary action (2d) and two secondary actions (1d) chosen when you recruit them. They roll 0d on other actions.
- They don't have stress and can't resist.
- They don't gain xp, though you can upgrade them with gold.
- They can be paid 1 gold to perform a downtime action or go with you on a raid.
- They don't take shock, instead getting knocked out of scenes or bloodied when they would otherwise take shock.
- They take -1d to all rolls while bloodied and clear bloodied only on recovery.
- They can almost always avoid being destroyed by exiting a scene without a roll, running away, getting knocked out, or so on.
- They can gain **morale** which you can spend to take +1d on an action or fortune roll. Morale is gained from <ins>calamity rolls</ins>, but the GM can also award minions with morale when there is an outstanding moment in the story or the PCs take specific action to improve it. Minions can only have one morale at a time.

#### Recruiting Minions

You can recruit minions by spending 1 gold or performing a downtime action. Either way, you need a plausible way to get minions to come into your dungeon. Look at the factions around you or talk with the GM to see what other monsters might be on the map to find a good source of minions. When re-recruiting minions, it's sometimes easiest to keep all of the details the same and narrate how you replenish their ranks.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Your vile friend knows a slaver that sells you a pair of ogres.
> - You head to a nearby orc tribe and call in a favor the chief owes you.
> - You raid a kobold village, pressing everyone you can grab into service.

#### Creating Minions

When you recruit minions, you need to answer the following questions to flesh out the minion pack:
- How many are in the pack? (2-5)
- What race are they?
- What job are they filling?
- What's their primary action?
- What are their secondary actions?
- What's their dark impulse?
- Do you want to pay for upgrades?

Minions come in packs and are always members of the same **race**. Establish the **number of minions** in the pack. It might be as few as two powerful monsters, like a pair of ogres, or it might be as many as five smaller creatures. Then, choose a **job** which gives them a strong core concept and identity plus any basic gear they need for that job. Here are some example jobs:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Acolytes
> - Alchemists
> - Builders
> - Cutthroats
> - Envoys
> - Grunts
> - Mages
> - Miners
> - Priests
> - Raiders
> - Scouts
> - Thieves
> - Trappers
> - Tricksters
> - Witches
> - Workers

Next, assign one **primary action** (2d) and two **secondary actions** (1d) to the minions. Their job title is likely to influence this, such as builders having ***Smash*** or ***Tinker*** or scouts having ***Scan*** or ***Skulk***. If you give them ***Invoke***, you must also choose a path of magic that they can cast from. They can only cast tier 1 spells of that path.

Then, give your minions a **dark impulse** likely to pull them away from the tasks you've given them. Minion impulses tend to be substantially more disruptive, troublesome, or petty than Wicked Ones impulses. The GM can look to these impulses when deciding the consequences of action rolls or what trouble your minions might cause during a bad calamity in the dungeon. Here are some examples impulses:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Addicted
> - Aggressive
> - Disloyal
> - Greedy
> - Impatient
> - Lazy
> - Moody
> - Superstitious

You can then add **upgrades** from the list on the next page by spending gold. Finally, minions always gain **morale** when recruited.

#### Upgrades

Upgrades are additional advantages that your minions have. Each upgrade costs 1 gold and you can add them during the lurking phase. This gold represents resources directed from your hoard to recruit higher quality minions or provide them with additional training, equipment, or motivation that improves their usefulness to the dungeon. If your minions are destroyed, you lose any upgrades they had.

- *Adept*: Your minions can cast a single tier 2 spell once per cycle. They take -1d on this as normal, but don't have to pay stress.
- *Equipped*: Your minions gain a defense of your choice from their gear.
- *Expendable*: Your minions don't need to be re-recruited with gold or a downtime action when destroyed. There are always more around, replenishing on recovery, and keep this upgrade when they come back. They cannot have any other upgrades besides those granted by a room or ability.
- *Fluent*: Your minions can speak the Light Tongue, but with a strong accent.
- *Mindset*: Your minions have a mental edge, which might be considered as a circumstance towards position and effect (choose one): *fearless* - *loyal* - *zealous*. You can also make up your own.
- *Strapped*: Your minions have 1 supply slot which can be used to access anything from your supply.
- *Trained*: Your minions take +1d on a specific type of downtime project (choose one): *brew* - *build* - *contact* - *craft* - *incant* - *recruit* - *torture*.
- *Versatile*: Your minions have another primary (2d) and two more secondary
(1d) actions.

*Companion* is a special upgrade only available to minion packs gained through calling abilities. When you first select the ability, they're automatically recruited. They will always join a raid without asking for gold and you can decide what happens to them when they're taken down. Maybe they were merely knocked out, ran away, or were actually killed. This gives them permission to live when other minions might not. They must still be recruited again as usual, including paying for any upgrades you previously bought for them. The gold or downtime action might represent tending their wounds or going out to find them.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Minions are Characters, Too!
> When roleplaying minions, it’s important to remember that they have their own motivations. They're not just an extension of your PC, they're a second character. The pack as a whole has a group personality. Try to lean into this concept and their expendable nature when narrating their actions!
