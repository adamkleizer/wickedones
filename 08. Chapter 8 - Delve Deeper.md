# Delve Deeper

> "Gotta go deeper, always deeper. The deeper you go, the
more you find. Just keep digging and you'll eventually come
across-woah, hold up! Holy hell boys! Get down here and check
this out! I think we just hit the motherlode!"

&mdash; Crem, Goblin Minion

## Primal Monsters

The monsters you play in *Wicked Ones* tend to be very similar in many ways to humans. They all have two arms, two legs, and one head. They use gear and equipment and don't have many natural abilities. Stepping away from that simple archetype, you can also build monsters using ***Primal Ability*** or reframing some of the calling abilities to match up with what a monster might do, such as modelling a troll's regeneration or a harpy's luring song.

The most complex monsters, however, require larger changes to fully capture. They can't be imagined with a combination of ***Primal Ability*** and a reskinning of other calling abilities. These are primal monsters, and in place of a calling's core ability and starting calling ability, they gain several fundamental mechanical changes and unique abilities.

**Every player must agree to allow a primal monster in play.** They have a tendency to become the center of the story or even consider themselves to be the dungeon boss. It's important to talk about how a primal monster might see itself before deciding whether to allow it into a campaign or not. A dungeon that's devoted to hatching and raising, then being ruled by a Goldmonger could be fun, but it could also be a chore that some players might not want to participate in. Making sure everyone is on the same page is essential.

**Primal monsters are recommended for experienced players.** The rule changes can be quite a lot for new players to grasp. Having a solid familiarity with the base rules also helps highlight exactly how the rules changes are meant to feel in play, making it easier to see why a change was made to represent that primal monster. It's might also be a good idea to limit it to one primal monster in any dungeon.

As you can see, primal monsters can be a bit disruptive to the normal flow of campaigns. Below is a brief overview of how the four primal monsters in the book tend to alter campaigns in ways that normal callings don't.

- **Braineaters** require living meals. Capturing prisoners and saving them for later becomes a priority. They're also very weak when they can't feast.
- **Doomseekers** tend to stay within the dungeon, sending out their proxy minions in their place. They're also incredibly paranoid, which has a tendency to bring them into conflict with other PCs.
- **Facestealers** are often working on their own, having small scenes while other players wait. Making sure everyone gets enough screen time can be difficult.
- **Goldmongers** can't spend gold and don't work on downtime like other PCs. They will strongly urge the dungeon tier to grow rapidly, but it's likely that dungeon defenses will lag behind.

So, before beginning any campaign with a primal monster in it, talk it through with everyone and make sure all players know the effect it can have on gameplay. If you get everyone on board, the unique mechanics can give a fresh, new dynamic to the game.

### Braineater

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Voracious Psionic Masters

The delicious energy hidden within the brains of intelligent creatures calls to you. You crave it, engaging in a neverending search for your next harvest. This endless hunger may even force you to join forces with those you might otherwise consider food.

#### Braineater Traits

***Psionic Disciplines***: You have four psionic disciplines, detailed on the next page, which allow you to manifest psionic powers. Each discipline functions like a magic path. At character creation, you can assign 3, 2, 1, and 1 dots to these disciplines and you roll them as an action when you manifest powers within that discipline. You can spend stress to manifest tier 2 and 3 powers, taking dice penalties like when casting a spell.

***Psionic Masteries***: Each discipline has two masteries, advanced techniques brought about by fully mastering the discipline. When you have 3 dots in a discipline, you gain one of its two masteries. The second mastery can later be taken with wicked xp.

***Psionic Dependency***: Your reliance on psionics has stunted growth elsewhere. You only place 2, 1, 1, and 1 dots in normal actions at character creation.

***Psionic Advancement***: You do not have calling abilities like other callings. When your wicked xp is full, you can add a dot in a discipline, take a second mastery in a 3-dot discipline, or use your flexibility slot to take a calling ability.

***Feasting***: You no longer clear all stress automatically each recovery. Instead, you feast on brains to handle your stress and hunger. This is possible to do during any scene. This requires a *living victim* that is *subdued* or *restrained* and you're very vulnerable while you take the time to feast.

    **Hunger** dominates your thoughts. Failing to feast on the brain of a living, intelligent creature at least once per cycle weakens you. You become bloodied during recovery if you failed to feast during the previous cycle.

    **Weak brains** barely satiate your hunger. This sets your stress clock to 3 ticks regardless of whether you had more or less ticks before.

    **Delicious brains** from a worthy foe or from a victim with particularly interesting memories completely satiate your hunger. You clear all stress.

Your revelry is also ***Feasting***. This covers not only the eating of brains, but also the satisfying of your curiosity as you flitter through the memories in the brains you've consumed. When you overdo it, you might take shock from the flood of memories or hunger for more brains, turning on your dungeon's denizens.

#### Psionic Disciplines & Masteries

Psionic disciplines function as magic paths, though they don't require you to have a magic focus. Each discipline has two masteries listed underneath it.

##### Deception

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> You ***DECEIVE*** the minds of others into believing what you want.

- ***Mind Blur***: You can spend stress to make anyone not aware of your presence simply unable to notice you until you give them cause to. This lasts for several moments. Once noticed, it is much harder to use it against them again.
- ***Devious Intent***: On a critical with a deception power, you gain a dark heart. On a failure, you can choose to spend stress to change the result to a mixed instead.

##### Domination

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> You ***DOMINATE*** the minds of others to do your bidding.

- ***Thrall***: You can perform a tier 1 ritual to turn a subdued adventurer into a thrall, occupying your minion slot. It has the companion and mindset (loyal) upgrades. It also has an extra action with a rating equal to its tier and a calling ability that represents something it can do. If the ability requires it to spend stress, you can spend stress for them.
- ***Null Field***: You can spend stress to create a spherical null-field, within which all magic ceases to function. Anyone who attempts to cast receives a sharp mental rebuke. The sphere itself is crystalline and vulnerable to physical attack or your concentration being broken.

##### Telekinesis

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> You ***CONTROL*** objects in the environment around you.

- ***Levitation***: You can levitate as easily as you can walk. You can also spend stress to fly through the sky as swiftly as a hawk for a short time.
- ***Warding***: You have honed your telekinetic abilities to maintain a reflexive guard around you. You can spend stress to fully resist a physical attack as if you had used a defense. *What form does your guard take?*

##### Telepathy

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> You ***READ*** the thoughts and memories of others.

- ***Awareness***: You're constantly scanning the surface thoughts of those around you. You're never surprised by living creatures and can always act first. You can spend stress to have the GM reveal a secret about an NPC the first time you meet them.
- ***Prescience***: Delicious brains can't help but reveal their intentions to you. Any adventurer using a defensive move against your psionic powers takes -1d. When you resist adventurer offensive moves, you take +1d.

### Doomseeker

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Paranoid Aberrations

You're an ancient guardian of a long-lost dungeon, finally freed from the pact that kept you bound to it. A creature of caution, you know you need to surround yourself with "allies" as a buffer against destruction.

#### Doomseeker Traits

***Eye Rays***: You have nine eyes, each able to shoot a different magical ray. At character creation, you assign a ray to each eye. These are explained in detail on the next page.

***Bizarre Body***: You can float through the air with supernatural buoyancy. You don't have gear and therefore no gear defense, but you do have supply. Your teeth are also as dangerous as a weapon.

***Paranoia***: Your dark impulse is ***Paranoid***. This impulse makes it difficult for you to leave the dungeon, strongly preferring to instead send minions on raids. You must spend 2 stress to suppress any compels outside of the dungeon.

**Guardian XP**: You have guardian xp in place of reckless xp, marking 1 xp for each session in which you were neither bloodied nor went feral. When you hit 3 xp, you can either increase an eye ray's action rating (max of 3d) or add an action dot.

***Meticulous***: On a success during a flashback, you gain a dark heart and an ally takes +1d on any follow-up roll.

***Support***: After an ally rolls, you can spend a dark heart to give them an additional +1d on the roll. *How did you prepare them for the challenges to come?*

***Overseer***: Your minions can resist consequences using their actions, though you take or clear stress instead of them when they do. Explain how you warned them ahead of time to handle the consequence. You also get an extra downtime action which you can only use to recruit minions.

***Ultimate Flexibility***: You begin with no abilities, but you have 5 flexibility slots to use when you gain an ability from xp. The following abilities are recommended:

- **Conniver**: ***Missed a Spot***, ***Weaving the Web***
- **Crafter**: ***Brewmaster***, ***Scrutiny***
- **Marauder**: ***Cohort***, ***Commander***
- **Shadow**: ***Dark Mind***, ***Unseen Hand***

#### Eye Rays

Your eyes have magical eye rays that act as a very narrow magical path. You can cast tier 1 spells with them and can also spend stress to cast a tier 2 spell, taking -1d on the roll as normal. However, you can't cast tier 3 spells. You have the following nine eye rays:

- ***Death Ray***: Harms any living thing it hits, necrotizing flesh and plant matter.
- ***Transmogrification Ray***: Shapes inanimate objects into new forms.
- ***Paralysis Ray***: Wrecks a target's nerves, temporarily paralyzing them.
- ***Bewitchment Ray***: Makes the target act to help you in some way.
- ***Time Ray***: Modifies time, speeding it up or slowing it down, in a limited bubble.
- ***Null-Magic Ray***: Creates a small area inside which magic does not function.
- ***Vision Ray***: Sees the unseeable, such as through walls or at great distances.
- ***Telekinesis Ray***: Moves objects and other non-living, solid matter.
- ***Fear Ray***: Strikes fear in their heart, pushing them towards irrational action.

You have nine eyes, each with an action rating. At character creation, you assign each eye a specific eye ray that it casts. When you cast spells, you roll that eye's rating in place of ***Invoke***. Your large, main central eye is 3d, your outer eyestalks are 2d, and the other body eyes are 1d.

Your eye rays can be used to make resistance rolls and are affected by shock to ***GUTS***.

### Facestealer

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Devious Impersonators

You're a creature of deceit and exploitation, taking on the forms of those you lay eyes on and slipping deep within civilized lands. However, your powers are reviled and you're hunted, so it may be best to find a safe place to rest your head.

#### Facestealer Traits

***Shapeshifting***: You can spend stress to physically change your appearance and voice for a few moments into the form of a humanoid you can currently see. This includes the clothes they're wearing, but not items they're carrying.

***Facestealer Abilities***: You start play with one of the abilities on the next page and gain an additional one each time you fill your wicked xp.

***Faces***: You can spend stress to slide a copy of a completely helpless humanoid's face off of them. They must be alive when you do this. When you do so, draw some of its distinguishing features on your character sheet, then add a few details about the owner. You can shapeshift into the face's owner for as long as you like without spending stress, also gaining the ability to speak their language while shifted. You can only keep three such faces at a time and can replace one when you steal a new face.

***Voices***: The faces speak to you, wrestling for control of your mind. You do not have a dark impulse, instead being compelled by the faces. They might force you to hold off on taking an action they strongly oppose, stop to enjoy one of their own impulses, or do something out of character that might blow your cover.

***Grafting***: If you go feral while assuming the forms of one of your faces, that face permanently grafts itself onto you. It can no longer be replaced, taking up one of your three slots. It also costs you two stress to resist a compel from a grafted face.

***Hunted***: Your kind is hunted by civilization, which fears and despises you for your ability to pass among them unnoticed. Any time your cover is completely blown and you don't cover your tracks, the GM can pocket minor blowback.

***Mindspeak***: You can communicate telepathically with anyone you can see, though this communication is one-way and they always know who is speaking to them.

***Gearless***: You do not wear gear like a normal monster, finding it inhibits your ability to shift into a new shape. Since you have no gear, you also have no gear defense. However, you still have supply and most Facestealers will carry an inconspicuous bag of things they can use in a pinch. You can choose 6 items to put into your supply at character
creation.

#### Facestealer Abilities

##### Dramatic Reveal

You can reveal yourself with impeccable timing, taking advantage of people's shock. You take +1d on any action immediately after you reveal your true form.

##### Embodiment

You take on physical and personality traits of your faces. Each face has one action that it is especially good at and you act as if your rating is always at least 2d with it. On a critical with that action while in that face, you gain 1 wicked xp.

##### Grotesque Mutations

When you shift into a form, you can instead shift into a grotesque version of the form, such as *having multiple heads* or the *limbs are backwards*. You take +1d when horrifying someone with your appearance and on a success, you gain a dark heart.

##### Meddling

You excel at manipulating factions from within. You gain a downtime action that you can only use to try to tick faction clocks forwards or backwards. You're assumed to be using forms during this time, though you don't need to pay stress.

##### Perfect Entrance

You can spend stress to appear in any scene already shifted into one of your faces as long as you can reasonably explain how that face got there. When you do so, make a separate engagement roll to determine how good your cover is.

##### Shifting Tricks

You push your shifting powers to the limit and have learned a few useful tricks. You can spend stress to do one of the following for a few moments (choose one): *climb on walls like a spider* - *grow a weapon from your body* - *turn into a puddle of goo*.

##### Thought Thief

You can skim the surface thoughts of those unaware of your true nature. When you enter a scene shapeshifted, you can establish a single fact that one of them has on their minds at that moment. You take +1d when you act on that knowledge.

##### Facestealer Items
| | |
|:-:|:-:|
| garrote | listening cup |
| writing utensils | tools |
| pipe & tobacco | rope |
| dagger | perfume |
| manacles | blowgun |
| hourglass | lockpick |

### Goldmonger

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Greedy Tyrants

You're driven by your lust for gold. It's your obsession as well as fueling your growth. You start as a small whelp, growing alongside your hoard, eventually becoming a terror. But before then, you need some "allies" to help build your hoard.

#### Goldmonger Traits

***Type***: There is an element, part of nature, or mystical source of energy that forms the core of your being and manifests in various ways within your abilities. This is your ***type***. The effects possible with it are judged similarly to spell magic tiers, though you never take dice penalties on the roll. When a roll is called for using it, you roll ***Invoke***. While your type gives you strength, it also creates a weakness. This is your ***anti-type***, a similar source of power that directly opposes the core of your being. You have a vile hatred of it as well as a vulnerability towards it. Choose each of these at character creation from the list below or make up your own:

[context]: # (complete list)
> - acid
> - crystal
> - fire
> - earth
> - energy
> - ice
> - illusion
> - lightning
> - metal
> - mind
> - plant
> - shadow
> - shimmering
> - sonic
> - venom
> - water
> - wind

***Primal Body***: The nature of your form makes it impossible to use items. You do not have gear or supply. However, your claws, teeth, and tail are as deadly as a weapon.

***Hatchling***: You start as an egg ready to hatch or a recently hatched whelp. At character creation, you assign 2, 2, 2, 1, and 1 action dots and advance one step in three of the growth paths detailed on the next two pages.

***Growth***: You grow alongside your hoard. When the dungeon tier increases, you add an action dot and advance one step in two separate growth paths. You also grow in size. At tier 0, you're just a tiny whelp and humanoids have scale against you. By tier 1, you can stand on equal footing with them. At tier 3, you now have scale against them. You can also choose not to grow in size when you increase tier.

***Pleased XP***: You do not gain wicked or reckless xp. Instead, at the end of each session, you can give 1 wicked xp to the PC that pleased you the most this session. You can still gain practice xp.

#### Slumber

You do not make loot rolls. Instead, you enjoy nothing more than curling up on your hoard for a nice, long nap. Your time spent slumbering also means you have no downtime actions. As others roll loot, you make a **slumber roll**.

[context]: # (roll summary)
> ##### Slumber Rolls
> You roll a number of dice equal to the amount of loot from
your last raid.
>
> **Failure**: Your slumber is disturbed and you overdo it, wreaking havoc on the dungeon or surrounding countryside in some way.  
**Mixed**: You slumber, albeit restlessly, gaining a dark heart.  
**Success**: You slumber deeply, filling all of your dark hearts as you dream of (choose one): *an interesting faction scene* - *the location of great treasure* - *secrets of the past*. Establish a fact you saw.  
**Critical**: Also, you awaken invigorated and can increase a type effect's tier by 1 once this cycle!

#### Growth Paths

Your growth is defined as you advance along six growth paths, each with a chain of three abilities. When you advance a growth path, you always move from the top down and gain the abilities in order. At each opportunity to advance a growth path, you can only move along it one step.

##### Breath

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> *You fire dangerous blasts from your maw.*

1. You can unleash your breath as a powerful blast, a tier 1 effect of your ***type***.
2. You can spend stress to increase the power of your blast to a tier 2 effect.
3. When you go hard with a blast, you increase the tier by 1 instead of gaining +effect. On a success when going hard, you gain a dark heart.

##### Ferocity

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> *You rend your enemies to bits with tooth, claw, and tail.*

1. Your natural weaponry (choose one): *have an edge* - *become a tier 1 magic item of your ***type****. Appropriate edges may be *corrosive*, *powerful*, or *terrifying*.
2. You add another edge or the magic item increases to tier 2. On a critical when using your natural weaponry, you gain a dark heart.
3. On a success in close combat, you can spend stress to (choose one): *cleave into a nearby enemy* - *manifest your ***type*** (tier 1)* - *swallow them* - *swat them away*.

##### Flight

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> *You take to the skies to rain death from above.*

1. Your wings are powerful enough to fly, though you must spend stress to launch yourself into the air when under threat. You lack fine control over your flight.
2. Your wings grow stronger and more dependable and you now have even fine control over your flight. You also gain a defense against missile attacks.
3. You can spend stress to perform an incredible feat of flight, like *dive bombing at high speeds* or *generating huge gusts of wind*. You can also use this to carry a rider or haul large cargo.

##### Hide

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> *Your scales provide you with greater protection.*

1. Your scales (choose one): *have an edge* - *become a tier 1 magic item of your ***type****. Appropriate edges may be *camouflaged*, *slippery*, or *spiked*. You also gain
a defense that comes from your scales.
2. On a success when resisting a physical attack, you can (choose one): *break their weapon* - *manifest your ***type*** (tier 1)* - *strike fear in their heart*.
3. You can spend stress to manifest an aura of your ***type*** around you that lasts for a few moments. When someone enters the aura, make a fortune roll using ***Invoke*** to see if they're affected by a tier 1 effect of your ***type***.

##### Lair

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> *Your lair is an extension of yourself.*

1. Once per dungeon defense, you can manifest your type as a trap, trick, or lock anywhere in the dungeon. You can spend dark hearts on these rolls.
2. You can manifest your ***type*** a second time as a trap, trick, or lock anywhere in the dungeon. On a success, you gain a dark heart.
3. You can now have a maximum of three dark hearts. After you successfully defend your dungeon from invasion, you fill all of your dark hearts.

##### Tyranny

[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Your presence within the dungeon can't be ignored.

1. Your dungeon's imps take +1d on their downtime action and you control what they work on, not the GM. You also take +1d on power struggles.
2. Your reputation brings in minions devoted to serve you. They have the *companion* and *expendable* upgrades. They will also perform one downtime action each downtime without asking for gold.
3. You roam the region around your dungeon, reigning terror. State a goal and start a faction clock representing it. Once per downtime, you can awaken from your slumber and take a downtime action to work towards the goal.

## Wandering Ones

While *Wicked Ones* is a game wholly focused on monsters building a dungeon, not all evil emanates from the confines of subterranean lairs. Wandering Ones is **dungeonless gameplay**, detaching you from your home base and allowing you to wander the lands. The following is an overview of gameplay changes and features:

- **Setting creation occurs as normal.** Choose a sandbox and create factions together. It's best to wander around a single or a few sandboxes, with the faction clocks making for great story generators. Factions are assigned tiers, but only used to measure the faction's presence and challenge level - there is no dungeon tier.
- **The pact replaces the dungeon.** Each group of monsters has a reason to be travelling together - choose a pact motivation and link it to factions within the sandbox you've chosen, then build your characters as normal with this in mind.
- **Pact abilities replace dungeon rooms.** These are split into four categories for ease of reference - Battle, Meddling, Mysticism, and Utility. The pact chooses one ability when you begin play and you gain a new one each time a story arc culminates.
- **Story arcs replace the master plan.** You lay out the direction you want the story to move in, then gain pact abilities for playing out those arcs (next page). You now gain xp for making progress on your story arc.
- **Short and long downtimes replace the cycle of play.** The group decides when to take a break and recharge, with full recovery only happening during long downtimes. Each downtime, the GM rolls faction clocks (next page).
- **Travelling is abstracted with wander rolls and encounters.** As you move across the map, you are likely to encounter dangers, obstacles, and chances (pg. 350)!
- **Calamity is gone, though blowback still occurs.** The GM has full discretion on when blowback is rolled - roll it when it makes sense for the world to respond.
- **Plans replace raid plans.** These are identical, but do not have to be "raids" - just handy tools that allow you to jump straight into the action from any point. In other cases when starting conditions are unclear, use engagement rolls as usual.
- **Supply now represents your packed items.** When you tick a supply slot, it means you have it on hand. Supply slots reset if you have time to access your backpack.
- **Downtime projects are slightly changed.** Build is removed. Gather info has been added, allowing you to take an action to attempt to establish a fact. Abilities that give extra downtime actions work during both short or long downtimes.
- **Loot is gathered and rolled during any downtime.** A moderate challenge provides one loot and a difficult challenge provides two. Good loot and loot for bringing down adventurers remain the same, adding to the pool.
- **You can now hold 5 gold.** Buying items, information, or npc/faction help costs twice its tier in gold. Minions no longer need to be paid to accompany you on raids, but require 1 gold each long downtime - which companions do not require. You can also pay gold to an NPC to get an assist on a downtime action.
- **Wicked XP changed.** You now gain xp for jumping into a minion downtime action.

### The Pact

The pact replaces the dungeon, binding the group together in shared purpose. Once the sandbox and factions have been set, you begin by choosing a **motivation** on the pact sheet for your group, then deciding on their **first story arc step**. After this, you make a character that fits in with the themes you've all settled on as a group to play into.

A pact's motivations may change over time - it has no mechanical bearing, but it's good to keep the group on theme when setting up story arcs. Changing your motivation might be a group discussion after a story arc culminates - or even a power struggle.

#### Story Arcs

**Story arcs** are shorter versions of the master plan. Each arc has two steps and a culmination which, when finished, allows you to take a new pact ability. The steps along an arc do not need to be accomplished or "won," but merely played through - and in doing so, a story emerges. Even failing to accomplish what you set out for leads into the next step in the story and the arc changes along with that.

Each step in the arc should be the focus of a session or two and once played through, you discuss what the next step is. The culmination is more similar to a pillaging raid in scope - a larger event that should take multiple steps to accomplish. It's possible to have more than one story arc going at a time - though a max of two is recommended and you can only mark off at most one arc per session.

### Downtime & Faction Clocks

**Short** and **long downtimes** represent significant periods of rest. Things like taking a breather or camping are assumed to be a part of traversing the world. The players choose when to take downtimes, though two downtimes cannot be chained together - something significant must happen before another can be taken.

- **Short downtime**: A period of relative peace and calm, a respite lasting up to a week. During short downtimes, you can (choose two): *clear 3 stress* - *gain a dark heart* - *perform a downtime activity* - *remove 1 shock*.
- **Long downtime**: A period of safety, lasting anywhere from a few weeks to even an entire season. This requires a friendly settlement, dungeon, or other well-defended area to rest within - which may cost you. Time skips ahead rapidly. You go through recovery, clearing all stress and shock and can take a downtime action.

**At the beginning of any downtime, the GM rolls faction and any other relevant clocks.**

[context]: # (tips)
> ### This Game Was Not Built For This
> Keep in mind that this is a light adaptation of the rules, designed to change as little as possible. Any group brave enough to delve into this mode will need to make common sense rulings when things break. Also, there aren't new character sheets for this mode.

### Traversing the World

Movement from place to place is done by setting waypoints, choosing two points of interest on the map and setting the stakes for travelling between them. *Is it a dangerous journey? How long will it take? What might stand in your way?*

The length of the journey is flexible - this could be a day or two or even longer on large maps like the Warzone or just moving across town like the City Sewers map. Resting and camping along the way is all backgrounded into a single **wander roll** to see if anything came up while travelling. Each time you travel between two significant points, you make a wander roll. Depending on the results of the roll, you might have some kind of encounter. Encounters aren't necessarily bad, but they are always diversions and risk costing resources before you arrive at your destination.

**Encounters always begin with an engagement roll to set the scene with the action already in progress.**

**Minor encounters** are brief scenes that provide a test of skill and give characters a chance to shine, make use of their abilities, play into their dark impulses and revelries, and earn some dark hearts.

**Major encounters** are big events, likely significant challenges that need to be overcome or are difficult to avoid. They should tax character resources or present outright threats to their lives or current goals.

## Valiant Ones

The monstrous callings in *Wicked Ones* are clearly based on typical fantasy archetypes, meaning they translate very well into typical fantasy games - and that's what Valiant Ones is! You can use the fiction-first and player-driven mechanics of *Wicked Ones* to play from the other side, taking on the role of adventurers and heroes out to rid the world of evil or just go wherever adventure takes you!

While the underlying fundamentals of the game remain largely the same, the following is an overview of gameplay changes, adjustments, and new features:

- **Based on Wandering Ones.** Every change that is made for wander mode also applies to Valiant Ones, including the pact sheet and motivations. Factions and sandboxes are set up in the same way and story arcs are used to drive the plot along. Any other changes from the original game or wandering ones are outlined below.
- **New valiant callings.** Valiant Ones takes the original callings and remixes them into heroic archetypes. The new callings are ***Artificer*** - ***Bard*** - ***Cleric*** - ***Druid*** - ***Monk*** - ***Ranger*** - ***Rogue*** - ***Sorcerer*** - ***Warrior***. These callings are only available directly on their new character sheets, which can be downloaded at banditcamp.io.
- ***Some simple renaming changes the tone of the game.*** The following terms have been renamed: ~~Dark bargains~~ *Tough choices* - ~~Death knells~~ *Heroic deaths* ~~Dark hearts~~ *Hearts* - ~~Reckless XP~~ *Adventurous XP*.
- **Motivations replace dark impulses.** These work the same as dark impulses and can be compelled. They are identical to pact motivations, but you choose one that represents your own character's specific reason for adventuring - the story often works better when motivations pull characters in different directions.
- **Go big replaces go feral.** When you go big, you make a choice - play into your own motivation, your character arc, or your pact's story arc. Play stops and the group takes a moment to discuss it, then you take an action just like going feral.
- **Ability lists have been reworked.** There are no required core abilities and you begin play with your choice of two abilities from your calling list or taken with your two flexibility slots. Many abilities have been renamed or reworked.
- **Flashbacks have been reworked.** Each calling has new valiant flashback examples.
- **Valiant XP replaces Wicked XP.** You gain xp for pact story arcs, significant character moments, playing up motivations, and jumping into downtime actions
- **Retrospective Character Arcs.** At the end of each session, you can recall one significant, meaningful moment from the session that helped your character grow. Describe the scene and what you learned. Work towards building three of these moments into a final culminating moment, at which time you take an extra adventurous xp. Character arcs can be reset at any time.
- **Hirelings replace minion packs.** They are usually an individual instead of a pack and have one good trait and one bad trait. *Expendable* has been removed.
- **Revelries have been adjusted.** They are now a bit more typical of adventurers. Having too many hearts can still cause you to overdo it.

## Big Bad Wicked One - Solo Gameplay (or One PC / One GM)

A classic dungeon is led by a single, powerful leader ready to bring their own master plan to fruition. You take on the role of this Big Bad Wicked One, leading several minion packs as you build a dungeon on your own.

**This is not a comprehensive guide on solo roleplaying**, but more some rules changes and basic guidelines to follow to facilitate solo roleplay. It assumes familiarity with basic solo roleplay concepts. A good starting point is [the solo roleplaying subreddit](www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying).

The design framework for *Wicked Ones*, its fiction-first mechanics, failing forward dice rolls, and GM and player best practices keep gameplay flowing smoothly.

The following is an overview of gameplay changes, features, and advice:

- **You will need** a Big Bad Wicked Ones version of the character sheet of your choice, a dungeon sheet, and a GM sheet. The **Toolkit Deck** is also a very handy resource.
- **Stick mostly to the cycle of play.** It's recommended to follow the session 0/1 setup and then play the game through as it leads you, from which the story emerges.
- **Go on raids or simulate them.** Use the raid generator to mix up and randomize gameplay or choose your own raid plans and targets. You can also choose to send your minions out and simulate the raid instead, focusing more on the dungeon.
- **Ask questions and let fortune rolls answer them.** If you're unsure about what might happen, list some options or **spark imagination** (pg. 356) and use a fortune roll to decide how it plays out. You can also use the random tables collected here.

The player character grows stronger in the following ways:

- **Actions.** You begin with an extra 3d action and all actions have a maximum of 4d.
- **Abilities.** You start with an extra ability, two flexibility slots, and can take core abilities from other callings.
- **Increased Stress.** You have an 8-segment stress clock.
- **More Downtime actions.** You have two downtime actions each lurking phase.
- **Minion pack changes.** You can control up to three minion packs and begin play with one. They also go on raids without requiring gold, assuming a share in the loot.
- **Increased loot.** You roll twice as much loot as normal and can hold up to 5 gold.

### Raid Generator

Sometimes, you might have a clear idea on exactly how you want to raid. But allowing some randomness into the process to mix things up also allows for more varied gameplay, which works great for creating emergent stories. To generate a raid, first roll to choose a plan, then set the target conditions. Once you know these, work backwards to find a suitable target and goal, then answer the raid plan questions. Finally, roll engagement. For added variety, you can also roll up some chaos to throw into the mix.

### Minion Raids (simulate raids or play them as minions!)

You can choose to send your minions out alone on a raid, giving your PC an extra downtime action. To simulate a raid, first setup a raid and make an engagement roll as normal. Sending less than three minions is a negative factor. Sending minions with upgrades is a positive factor. Roll this pool on each of the following tables and blend the results into one story of how it went. **You can also spend morale, taking +1d on a single roll below each time.** After the raid, consider the results and make a blowback roll.

### Invasion Generator

So an invasion is occurring, whether it be prompted by blowback, calamity, a ritual, or even the story demanding it. Invasions are split between minor and major and are usually prompted by a blowback or calamity roll. But even within those levels, there are some judgement calls to be made and this is a knob to turn to adjust the game.

**A normal major invasion consists of a party of three adventurers equal to the dungeon tier.** It's from this default that you can adjust the difficulty to up or down by changing their tiers, adding hirelings, and so on. As with the normal gameplay in *Wicked Ones*, this is very much a matter of taste in how challenging you want the dungeon defenses to be, but also how well you have built your dungeon. Below are some random tables you can use to generate an invading adventuring party if you'd like.

### Spark Imagination

**Sparks** are used to spark your imagination, to give you a few words to get your mind thinking on something when you need a detail for the game. You roll on the first table and choose one of the two words, then roll on the second and mash the concepts together, using them as the basis to imagine something to bring into play.

So let's say you need to create a guard for a wizard's tower you're about to raid. An *ominous memory* might bring back an old enemy you've fought before, a *smoky shade* could simply be a smoke golem that fades in and out of sight, or a *hideous artisan* is a horribly burned pyromaniac.

### Dungeon Generator

The following can be used to help fill out solo-play dungeons randomly or to generate a dungeon for a quick raid, a dungeon to attack during a Valiant Ones campaign, or whip up something for a quick dungeon defense one-shot.

First, choose a dungeon or roll on the random table below, then follow the normal dungeon creation process on pg. 170. Once that's finished, for each tier you want to add to the dungeon, do the steps below in random order. You can roll on the tables over the next few pages or decide for yourself. If you don't like the results, change them or roll again! At the end, adjust things that don't make sense. These random tables use 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 1d12, and 1d20, so get some dice ready.

- Roll a discovery, then use the random discovery tables on pg. 207.
- Add two of the following: *tier 1 room* - *tier 2 room* - *tier 3 room*.
- Add a lair and choose a creature at the current tier. Be sure to give it two traits.
- Add two of the following at the current tier: *lock* - *trap* - *trick*.
- Add a minion pack. Be sure to give it an impulse and an upgrade.

**There's no random table for tricks, so you must make your own!**

## No Dungeon is Forever

As the town fell, a lone elven scout watched the carnage. There would be major blowback for the PCs' actions. Realizing their folly in not intervening, the bravest elven heroes have now cut their way through the dungeon and into the sanctum.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: The lancer, blood running down her face from the falling rock trap, heads down the stairway. She gestures for the eldritch warrior and weaponsmith to follow. In the sanctum, you're all still licking your wounds from the raid on the town and pretty distracted.
>
> **The GM rolls 1d engagement and gets a failure!**
>
> **GM**: Yeah, you have no idea the adventurers are here. What have you all been doing during the fight on the first level?
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I'm totally asleep with my head on the table, snoring loudly. My hair and clothes are still singed from that *firebomb*.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I'm in my room sewing up the holes in my side from that pitchfork.
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I'm probably drowning myself in alcohol. I only got 1 stress left, so I'm pretty much on the edge.
>
> **GM**: The lancer enters the sanctum first and sees the orc snoring at the table. Knowing there's more, she gestures for her comrades to fan out and get ready. Slem, you drunkenly stumble into the room, shake your head, and see the lancer with her weapon held high, standing over Ulrot. Behind you on both sides of the door are the other two adventurers.
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: "What the hell??" I yell, waking up Ulrot. Then I chuck this bottle of liquor I'm drinking at her. It's ***Smash***. I want to knock her weapon away.
>
> **GM**: Hah, nice! This is <ins>dire</ins> and both you and Ulrot are open to consequences.
>
> **Slem rolls 1d Smash and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: Okay, you knock her lance out of her hands, so Ulrot's fine, but you're going to end up bloodied here, Slem.
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: The bottle smacks it out of her hands and I smile smugly, then suddenly feel a sharp pain. Looking down, I see a glowing sword sticking out of my belly. "Of course, there were more behind me." I fall to the floor.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I jump awake, then roar as I see these trespassers in our sanctum. It's Threaten. I'm trying to make this lancer break and run.
>
> **GM**: Roll it. Also, don't forget that you have shock to ***GUTS*** from the raid.
>
> **Ulrot rolls 1d ***Threaten*** (2d - 1d) and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: That's her last heart! The rocks earlier almost took her out. She doesn't have any moves left either. Tell us what happens.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: She takes a few steps back, looks at her friends, and says, "I'm... I'm so sorry," then runs back up the stairs. I turn to face the other two.
>
> **GM**: When you turn, you see that the weaponsmith is holding your axe, admiring it. He says something in the Light Tongue, which you can't understand, but the gist is, "It's going to be fun killing you with this."
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I hear all that roaring and come hobbling into the sanctum. The stitches rip out and blood starts leaking. I Invoke, telling the roots to entangle these two. I have a couple of dark hearts, so I might as well use one.
>
> **GM**: Tier 2 to get both of them. This is <ins>deadly</ins>, and don't forget your shock.
>
> **Crag rolls 2d ***Invoke*** (3d - 1d - 1d + 1d) and gets a failure!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Ouch. The roots start moving, but the eldritch warrior is faster. The glowing daggers hovering around him turn and fly through the air at me. I guess this is it for ol' Crag - my resistance roll here is going to suck.
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I'll resist for you! I still have a dark heart. From the ground, I use ***Finesse*** to leg sweep the eldritch warrior and break his concentration.
>
> **Slem rolls 2d ***Finesse*** (2d - 1d + 1d) and gets a failure!**
> 
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Ahhh, dammit! Sorry! Aaaand, that stress makes me go feral. My dark impulse is vengeance, so start thinking on what I should do.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Nah, it's cool. I have an awesome idea. The daggers strike true and I fall to my knees, blood pouring out of my mouth. I dig my hand into the soil, the roots entwining around my fingers. I look at you two and grin, then just say, "Run." I still have a dark heart. This is my death knell. I'm going to cast a tier 3 spell here and bring the sanctum down.
>
> **Crag rolls 2d ***Invoke*** (3d - 2d + 1d) and gets a critical!**
