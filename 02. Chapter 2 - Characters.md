# Characters

> “Why huddle in our caves as the humans across the wall feast on meat? We have the strength to take what we want. Today, we pillage! And tonight, we feast! Let's show them the meaning of pain!"

&mdash; Grimmy, Goblin Conniver

## Becoming a Wicked One

The world is littered with “normal” monsters - goblin farmers and orc fisherman, weaklings that huddle in their tiny villages far from civilization, hoping humans don’t cast an eye on them. But that’s not you - you crave power and riches. You spit on those fools, hiding in their straw huts. No, you’re a Wicked One and you're looking to carve out your own place in this world.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Characters work best when they fit in nicely with the overall dungeon style. It’s highly recommended to make characters after some group decisions have been made during a session zero such as what sandbox you’ll be playing in, what your dungeon style is, and what monster races are allowed as PCs.

### Monster Races

Dungeons can make for strange bedfellows, pushing even unlikely combinations of evil creatures together. However, the term “monster” is very broad in definition and requires the players and GM to refine it a bit for purposes of selecting races that the PCs can be from. Work together with your group to choose from one of these three themes:
- **Keep It Simple**: All PCs must be humanoid with two arms and two legs, nothing bigger than a bugbear or smaller than a kobold. *(Recommended for new players)*
- **We’re All Family**: All PCs must be members of a specific monster race, perfect for a highly themed dungeon.
- **Anything Goes**: PCs are free to play as anything, from oozes to mushroom people to magically awakened evil squirrels. *Almost* anything goes, with the GM having final say.

**The choice of race should have as little mechanical effect as possible.** While race can be considered as a circumstance towards position and effect, it’s best to use this only in the most obvious or extreme cases. Allowing players a wide range of choice, such as a hulking kobold or a small, sneaky orc, makes for more interesting characters and satisfied players. If a race has a unique ability, something beyond being a simple bipedal creature that functions similarly to a human, it's represented in the following two ways. 
- **<ins>Primal monsters</ins>** are monsters with multiple unique abilities or require gameplay changes that fundamentally alter how they interact with game’s core mechanics. They’re for experienced players and more information can be found in <ins>Chapter 8: Delving Deeper.</ins>
- For monsters that have some unique ability that other monsters can’t do but don’t require extensive mechanical changes, you can take ***Primal Ability*** to bring them into play. It’s detailed later in this chapter.

#### A Blank Slate

When setting up the dungeon, it’s recommended that all of the PCs be new to the area. This means that any backstory the character has is light on details and mostly irrelevant - we’re more concerned with the dungeon and its story moving forward. The monster races covered in this book reflect this. They give a few broad concepts of what members of that race might be like, but players are free to take them in any direction they like. You can define that race's traits through your own play. So make them whatever seems fun!

#### Typical PC Races

There’s a plethora of fantasy monster races that work just fine as PCs, but the six presented on the next few pages are solid choices for new players and are all present in the art throughout this book. Each of these races has a short description to give a few ideas to latch onto for a character concept, though the exact details of monster attitudes and societies are up to you to decide. **The GM makes the final call on what races are allowed as PCs.**

#### Languages

**All monster factions speak a common language called the Dark Tongue**, while civilized factions speak the Light Tongue. Neutral factions might know one, both, or neither of these. It's rare for a member of a civilized faction to know the Dark Tongue or a monster to know the Light Tongue. PCs can learn the Light Tongue with the Conniver calling ability ***Tongues*** or give their minions the ***Fluent*** upgrade. However, many monsters know a few Light Tongue words, such as those listed below. These are a rough guide as to how much Light Tongue a PC knows.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Choosing Appropriate Monsters
> *Wicked Ones* isn’t just a game about monsters, but a game about monsters building dungeons. When choosing a monster race to play, make sure that it’s a monster that would actually have the need to live in a dungeon. Monsters that blend in with civilization, have advanced hiding capabilities, or can just fly their way out of trouble tend to not need to make a dungeon in the first place. Making the dungeon the center of your character concept and giving yourself a strong need for its existence tends to work best.

## Character Creation

Making a character is quick, usually done in ten to fifteen minutes. You can get the character sheets here: [banditcamp.io](https://banditcamp.io).

[comment]: # (numbered headers below are mentioning page numbers in the original text, removed these)

### 1. Choose a Monster Race

Choose a monster race following the theme your group agreed upon. The choice has little mechanical effect, only modifying position and effect in extreme cases, so choose something you think sounds fun to play!

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Bugbear
> - Demon
> - Goblin
> - Kobold
> - Orc
> - Slissik
> - Your own idea

### 2. Choose a Calling

Choose a calling, one of several paths that Wicked Ones follow. Your calling defines how you go about your monstrous work.

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Brute
> - Conniver
> - Crafter
> - Hunter
> - Marauder
> - Shadow
> - Shaman
> - Warlock
> - Zealot

Each calling provides you with the following:
- **Core ability**: Lets you spend stress to do something no other calling can do. You get your core ability at character creation.
- **Flashbacks**: Let you flashback and perform actions in the past that a member of your calling would have likely thought to do.
- **Calling abilities**: Let you customize what type of member of your calling you are. You take one at character creation and another each time you max out wicked xp.
- **Flexibility slot**: Lets you take a single calling ability from another calling’s list. You can't take a core ability with this.

Some abilities allow you to spend stress to perform **incredible feats**. If a normal monster can do something with an action roll, spending stress allows you to either automatically accomplish it or put you on equal footing. If a normal monster can’t perform it at all, spending stress allows you to make an action roll to attempt it.

[context]: # (example of play)
> You spend stress to use your Brute core ability, ***Rage***, to pick up a huge boulder. However, if you want to throw that boulder at a cart, you need to make an action roll.

Core abilities can be used on resistance rolls when you're not able to use an action to resist due to the action having ¸<ins>weak</ins> effect. Spending stress and using the ability puts you on equal footing, allowing you to roll the action to resist. This never results in an automatic resist.

### 3. Choose a Calling Ability

You begin play with your calling’s core ability and one calling ability from your calling's list. When an ability requires you to choose a benefit, you decide when you take it if it's a passive ability. If it's an ability that costs stress or works on a success, you make the choice each time you use it.

### 4. Choose Your Actions

Look through the list of actions and choose the ones that best match what your character is good at doing.
- **Put 3 dots in a single action.** This is what you’re best at, your bread and butter.
- **Put 2 dots in two other actions.** These are dependable and used often.
- **Put 1 dot in two other actions.** You’ve had a little practice with these.

### 5. Choose Your Dark Impulse

Look through the list of dark impulses and choose the one that best describes what pulls at your character’s attention. **Gain a dark heart** when you make your choice.

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Bigmouth
> - Cruel
> - Deranged
> - Fickle
> - Obsessed
> - Paranoid
> - Reckless
> - Vengeful

### 6. Choose Your Revelry

Look through the list of revelries and choose how your character likes to blow off steam. Your choice of revelry will determine what happens when you overdo it.

[context]: # (complete list)
> - Craving
> - Drinking
> - Gambling
> - Occult
> - Violence
> - Worship

### 7. Choose Your Gear, Supply and Gear Defense

Choose 4 items as your gear, the things you always carry on you, and decide your gear defense. Then, choose another 3 items that you begin with in your supply. Each calling has a list of example items to give you some ideas. One of the items you choose can be a *valuable item*: an item with an edge or a tier 1 contraption, magic item, or three doses of a potion or concoction. You can also take 1 gold instead of this. You can also choose to fill out your gear and supply later, as it comes up.

### 8. Pick a Vile Friend

Once your dungeon is established, choose a monster in the region you've made friends with during the <ins>initial dungeon setup</ins> montage. This vile friend gives you an easy way to connect to the world and can be paid for help, items, information, and so on.

> > “Sounds like a fair fight. Let's get the hell out of here.”

### Primal Ability

Some races have their own natural abilities that allow them to do something that other monsters can’t. To represent these natural abilities, you can take ***Primal Ability*** when you make a character in place of your calling’s core ability or first chosen calling ability. Work together with those at the table to determine the scope of the power. It should be around the power of a normal calling ability.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Primal Ability:** You have natural abilities that represent the things your race can do that others can’t. The total impact of these abilities should be similar to a normal calling ability. If an ability is something you activate, you spend stress to do so. If it's a passive effect, you must spend stress to use it in <ins>dire</ins> situations.
>
> If the abilities feel too strong, they can be coupled with one or two weaknesses to balance them out. These weaknesses represent unique challenges your race faces. Keep in mind that adventurers always know your weaknesses.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> A troll can regenerate their wounds, spending stress to remove the bloodied condition. They also have a keen sense of smell. As these are rather powerful, they have an extreme vulnerability to fire.
>
> A harpy can fly, albeit rather clumsily. They can also spend stress to sing a harpy song, allowing them to Trick unwitting victims into coming to find them over great distances.
>
> A duergar, a dark dwarf, can spend stress to grow up to three times their size. They can also see in darkness as if it were daylight.

***Primal Ability*** is a balancing act. It can easily overshadow other calling abilities, so the GM should maintain a tight purview over it. Keep its capabilities limited. If an ability from ***Primal Ability*** does a bit more than a calling ability or it feels too powerful, adding on weaknesses can help restore that balance. In some cases, you may be able to just reskin an existing ability, such as a Brute's ***Rage*** being used to represent the above duergar's ability to grow.

**Some abilities are simply too powerful to allow for normal PCs to have.** Monsters might also have several abilities which are beyond the scope of taking ***Primal Ability***. These monsters are better modelled as <ins>primal monsters</ins>, powerful monsters that have their own unique mechanics and abilities such as <ins>Goldmongers</ins> (dragons) or <ins>Facestealers</ins> (doppelgangers).

Some abilities such as flight or natural invisibility can be highly disruptive to campaigns, bypassing several challenges that would otherwise by interesting to deal with. GMs should carefully consider allowing abilities like these into the game. **The GM has final say on what is and isn’t allowed.**

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Bradley**: “I’m gonna make a frogperson with ***Primal Ability***. So maybe I can do a big frog jump, have a long tongue, and be a great swimmer.”
>
> **GM**: “What can you do with the tongue?”
>
> **Bradley**: “I think it can just reach out and grab stuff, maybe like a couple of meters away. Do I need to spend stress for that?”
>
> **GM**: “It sounds like a passive ability, kind of like an extra limb. So, you only have to spend stress if it’s a <ins>dire</ins> situation. Swimming too - that’ll probably let you operate in water without losing effect. But the big jump? Yeah, that’ll cost stress. How high can you jump?
>
> **Bradley**: “Maybe up on top of a 1 story building or so. It’s a frog, so I’m imagining it going pretty high, but nothing crazy.”
>
> **GM**: “You don’t have sticky hands or feet, right?”
>
> **Bradley**: “Yeah, it's not that kind of frog.”
>
> **GM**: “Okay, this isn’t all that overpowered. I think you could squeeze all of that in there even though it’s kind of a lot, but you’re gonna have to take a weakness.”
>
> **Bradley**: “What if I’m afraid of getting eaten, so I’m compelled to avoid dealing with anything like twice my size? Like a dark impulse, but it always goes off.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, that works. What calling?
>
> **Bradley**: I’m going to be a Hunter and take ***Primal Ability*** instead of my core ability so I can take ***Hunting Pet*** as my first ability - I need a seagull.

[context]: # (example of play)
> At first glance, an earth elemental might seem like a good candidate for ***Primal Monster***. However, the Brute's ***Rage*** ability represents their strength quite well and ***Living Weapons*** gives them pulverizing attacks and grappling roots. Add in a dot or two in ***Invoke*** with the wildheart witchcraft magic path and you can cast minor magic with the fireflies and plants living on them as well.

## A Wolf Pelt for a Ritual

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I'm gonna climb up the wall with ***Finesse*** to get a better look.
>
> **GM**: Simple enough. Let's see that roll.
>
> **Slem rolls 2d ***Finesse*** and gets a success!
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I make it up easily. Perched up here, I'm going to ***Scan*** to see where the dogs the merchant's son told us about are sleeping.
>
> **GM**: It's night and you can't see everything from where you're at. It's going to be <ins>weak</ins> effect.
>
> **Slem rolls 2d ***Scan*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: You're kinda limited on the info you can gain right now. Let's say that you don't spot the dogs, but you're sure they're not in the outer courtyard. Most likely, they're sleeping in the house.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I try to scramble up the wall, too. I have 0d in ***Smash*** and ***Finesse***, but they're the only actions that make sense. At least I'll get practice xp.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I'll assist, reaching a hand down to help out. That way we can at least be sure to get you up here on a mixed.
>
> **GM**: Makes sense. That'll be <ins>strong</ins> effect then. Remember that you're both open to consequences here.
>
> **Crag rolls 0d ***Smash*** (2d, keep the lowest) and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: Looks like you both go tumbling off the wall. Crag, you'll also end up with ***MUSCLES*** shock.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I walk up to the wall, then take several steps backwards, measuring it out. It looks calculated, like I know what I'm doing. Then I take off, running as fast as I can, and put a foot onto the wall and launch myself up it - up it and away from the wall. I yell, "Uh oh!" as I reach out.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Yeah, I see him about to throw himself away from the wall and, you know, I'm already committed, so I reach out and grab him. The momentum pulls us both off and, I guess I land on top of him.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: I just stand there shaking my head watching all of this. "It's a strike. We get in fast, we get what we need, we get out. What the hell are you two doing?" I run straight at the wall, put my shoulder down, and try to bash through it. My minion pack's gonna be right behind me, too.
>
> **GM**: Hmm, I don't know. I mean it's a reinforced wall built to not be knocked over. I just don't think it would work. It feels like <ins>zero</ins> effect.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: Yeah, obviously I'm gonna spend stress and ***Rage*** here.
>
> **GM**: Well, that's a different story. A second ago, I was a bit torn between whether it was <ins>zero</ins> or <ins>weak</ins> effect here, but with ***Rage***, I think it'll bump you up to normal effect. Make the roll.
>
> **Ulrot rolls 3d ***Smash*** and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: Yeah, you break through the wall, but your greedy minions are going to follow you through the hole, then run off to start looting on their own.
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: So I ***Smash*** through the wall, sending rocks flying everywhere. As the dust settles, I see my orc raiders poke their heads through the hole, look around, and get the bright idea to go looting. Suddenly, there's a loud CRACK of my whip lashing. I'm using my gear defense against minion mistakes here. I point at the house and they do as they're told.
>
> **GM**: The noise has woken up everyone in the house. You hear the dogs in there barking. The door opens and the dogs come busting out.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Hold up. I'm gonna spend stress and do a quick flashback to on the way to the estate. I want to have hunted down a boar. I know it's not something a shaman is too likely to do, but I'm a wildheart shaman so I think it makes sense. For the hunting, I just want to ***Tinker*** a trap.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, I could see Crag doing that. Let's see the roll.
>
> **Crag rolls 2d ***Tinker*** and gets a success!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Awesome. It was a simple pit trap and I butchered the boar that I caught, knowing the meat would come in handy. So right now, I push Slem off me, then stand up and pull out huge hunks of meat from my bag. "Hey pups, who's hungry?"
