# Dark Arts

> "Yesss... rise and serve, foul creature. Pull yourself from the depraved fires of hell. Lifetimes of torment you have suffered, but now it's time to revisit that suffering tenfold on those that have wronged us. Come pet, we have dark deeds to do."

&mdash; Slerrin, Slissik Warlock

## Mastering the Dark Arts

Some Wicked Ones are drawn to the power found within magic and science. They learn to cast spells tinged with darkness or craft insane contraptions. Others spend their time mixing concoctions, noxious alchemicals with bizarre effects, or engaging in complex rituals to taste the most powerful magic. These are the dark arts, whose power only a monster would dare risk trying to harness.

This chapter lays out how magic and science work, providing a framework and examples to show what's possible with them. The Dark Arts are governed by three sets of laws:

***The Laws of Monster Science*** cover the creation of mundane **items**, **edges**, **concoctions**, and **contraptions**. They're rated from tier 1 to tier 3 based on how dangerous and complex they are. You're limited in what you can create by the boundaries of pseudoscience.
- **Tier 1**: Creations that are simple and safe to make.
- **Tier 2**: Creations that are complex and risky to make.
- **Tier 3**: Creations that are convoluted and dangerous to make.

***The Laws of Spell Magic*** cover the casting of **spells** and creation of **potions**. They're rated from tier 1 to tier 3 based on how powerful the effects are compared to what a normal action can accomplish. You're limited in what effects you can conjure by the path of magic you wield.
- **Tier 1**: Effects replacing a normal action.
- **Tier 2**: Effects replacing a team effort or a long time solo effort.
- **Tier 3**: Effects replacing a long time team effort or the impossible.

***The Laws of Ritual Magic*** cover the incantation of **rituals** and creation of **magic items**. You're limited in what effects you can achieve by their impact on the fiction. At this level of magic, the more impactful it is, the more likely forces are to move against you to stop it.
- **Tier 1**: Effects with a minor impact on the story.
- **Tier 2**: Effects with a moderate impact on the story.
- **Tier 3**: Effects with a major impact on the story.

Magic and science can often achieve similar effects, but the biggest difference is in their limitations. Magic allows you to produce any effect unbounded by the laws of reality, but within a narrowly focused path. Science is limited only by your ability to explain it in a pseudoscientific fashion. Science focuses more on spending time and resources crafting, whereas magic can create effects on the fly within scenes by casting spells.

### Volatility

By their very nature, the dark arts are dangerous. This is a risk monsters are willing to take in exchange for power. This manifests in things created with magic or science sometimes becoming *volatile*. Magic items, concoctions, and potions can all be *volatile* unless perfectly crafted. Contraptions are *volatile* by their very nature.

When something has the *volatile* property, it comes with some drawback when using or even just carrying it. The exact nature of the volatility is decided by the GM and the player that crafted it, with the GM having final say. It should be something that still makes the item worth using, but is troublesome or annoying when you do.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - An essence of ice concoction that makes its container brittle.
> - A rage potion that makes you unable to tell friends from foes.
> - A monocle that reveals someone's thoughts, but yours to them as well.
> - A flamethrower that blazes hot, burning your hands.

*Volatile* tends to scale with tier, with the most powerful items having the greatest level of volatility. Minor items might give some small annoyance, but powerful items might be quite dangerous to wield. An item's volatility can come from crafting it or when found in loot, at the GM's discretion.

[context]: # (important rule)
> In the following pages, items are listed with a possible *volatile* property after the "but..." in the examples. If the item isn't *volatile*, it doesn't have that effect.

It's also important that the *volatility* is fun in play. Don't make an item *volatile* in such a way that it will never be used. That defeats the entire purpose. *Volatile* is almost like a dark bargain in this way - not quite bad enough to keep you from using the item, but definitely evokes a tinge of regret. If an item proves to be not worth using at all, perhaps revisit and change its *volatility*.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Science, Magic, and Game Balance
> Science and magic are freeform and open to creativity, but maintaining some semblance of balance in terms of power and utility versus other character options is a challenge. Clever players will push this system to its limits, always finding a way to squeeze more out of their magic and science. And you know what? That’s great! Let players be rewarded for their creativity. Position and effect reward it in a similar way. The rules within this chapter help set boundaries and operating within these boundaries is where creativity really shines. That said, GMs should be fierce in judging tiers and making sure players create interesting limitations. If a PC’s magic or science is overshadowing other characters, it might be time to redefine the boundaries.

## Laws of Monster Science

The laws of reality are made to be bent and twisted - a task many monsters find quite appealing. They put their brains to work, coming up with clever ways to achieve the most they can within the boundaries of reality.
- **Items and <ins>edges</ins>** cover any simple, mundane, or non-magical items with useful applications as well as any improvements to those items.
- **Concoctions** are combinations of reagents distilled into powerful elixirs.
- **Contraptions** are insane inventions that allow you to perform something otherwise impossible.

Science usually relies heavily on the ***Tinker*** action, though other actions are also applicable. A Hunter might ***Scan*** for herbs that they mix into a poultice or a Crafter might ***Finesse*** the fine details on the timing mechanism of a bomb.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **To craft something with science, you must explain the monster science behind what you're crafting or how you're crafting it.** The only limitation on what you can create with monster science is what can be reasonably explained in a monster science fashion. As long as you can make the thing you're crafting sound somewhat plausible, you're good to go. The GM is the final judge on this.

Science creations are rated from tier 1 to tier 3 according to how difficult or dangerous to craft they are. The tier is set by the GM.

### Tier 1 Science
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Simple, Safe

**These creations sound simple when explained with pseudoscience or are relatively safe to work on.** You can make mundane items, minor concoctions, and simple contraptions that accomplish something useful.

### Tier 2 Science
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Complex, Risky; Take -1d Brewing Concoctions

**These creations sound complex when explained with pseudoscience or are quite risky to work on.** You can add edges to items, make potent concoctions, and complex contraptions. When brewing concoctions of this tier, you take -1d to the roll.

### Tier 3 Science
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Convoluted, Dangerous; Take -2d Brewing Concoctions

**These creations sound convoluted when explained or are quite dangerous to work on.** You can create the craziest concoctions and contraptions. When brewing concoctions of this tier, you take -2d to the roll.

### Concoctions

Concoctions are single-use alchemicals thrown together in mad science laboratories, distilling and mixing reagents into powders, poultices, poisons, oils, and bombs. Herbal, plant, or fungal creations are also considered to be alchemical in nature. Concoctions are brewed by spending a <ins>downtime action</ins>. You make two doses with a single downtime action and it is always a tier 1 project, regardless of the tier of the concoction. If you roll a mixed on this downtime action, the concoction becomes *volatile*. A list of example concoctions can be seen on the next page, along with a possible effect and *volatility*. The effects and *volatility* of concoctions are determined by the player and GM when crafting them.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Brewing more potent concoctions carries more risk. You take -1d on the roll when brewing tier 2 concoctions and -2d when brewing tier 3 concoctions.

Concoctions are made using alchemical reagents, purified and distilled elements of the natural world. These tend to be things like minerals, herbs, or fungi. It's assumed that you can collect any ingredients you need when brewing and you can weave the collecting of them into your narration of the downtime action. Some examples are:

#### Alchemical Reagents

[randomizable]: # (alchemical reagent)
| | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| black powder | mold spores | quicksilver |
| brimstone | moondew | realgar |
| cold iron | mugwort extract | saltpeter |
| ginger extract | myrrh | sea salt |
| gold flakes | nightshade | silver |
| magnesium | phosphorus | thistle |


#### Adjusting Concoction Tiers

After setting the tier of a concoction, you can further amplify its effects as below. In doing so, it increases the tier of the concoction (max tier 3), making it more difficult or dangerous to create.
- Expand the **area** from a small to a medium area, or medium to large.
- Expand the **duration** from a short to a medium time, or medium to long.
- Expand the **scale** allowing you to affect targets that you might normally be in a tight spot against.

### Contraptions

Monster science can push the limits of what’s considered possible in a fantasy world: hot air balloons, rocket boots, portable catapults - you name it. These are called contraptions and with them, you can do almost anything you can imagine. Whether it's safe or not, though, is another matter entirely. 

On the next page is a list of example contraptions, what they do, and a possible *volatility* that they might have. What the contraption can accomplish and its *volatility* are determined by the player and GM when you start crafting it. Contraptions are made by using the craft <ins>downtime action</ins> with the tier of the downtime project determined by the tier of the contraption you want to make. When you want to craft something, describe what it is to the GM and they set its tier.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Contraptions are creations that don't already commonly exist, and for good reason. Every contraption is *volatile* in some way. Work with the GM when you finish making a contraption to choose the nature of its *volatility*.

**The technology level in a dungeon is "shoddy steampunk."** You can’t make anything you want. A monster isn’t going to whip up a computer. An airplane is probably impossible, but a dirigible might be doable! Incredibly complex creations are usually the culmination of several different contraptions. A mask that lets you breathe underwater and a small propeller might function as some sort of makeshift submarine. In the end, the GM determines the scope of technology.

### Items & Edges

Crafting a mundane item is a tier 1 downtime project. You can also improve on existing equipment by adding an edge as a tier 2 downtime project. Edges don't give new abilities like contraptions, but instead improve on existing functionality. Below are some examples:
- *Camouflaged*: Take +effect when sneaking in a forest.
- *Hidden*: Can be hidden more easily than a normal version.
- *Light*: Does not take up a gear slot. 
- *Terrifying*: Take +effect when using it to scare someone.
- *Trusty*: Extremely difficult to break or remove from your possession.
- *Pulverizing*: Take +effect when destroying stone or armor.
- *Powerful*: Excels at knocking back enemies.

You can create your own edges by working with the GM to decide their effects. Edges sometimes give +effect when using an item, though only within a limited scope. Edges can never make you better at killing things - weapons have already been honed over thousands of years into perfect killing tools.

[randomizable]: # (example contraptions)
#### Example Contraptions
| | |
|--|--|
| 11 | *Lighter*: Easily ignites flammable materials, but breaks easily.
| 12 | *Gas Mask*: Ignores the effects of gases, but you can barely see while wearing it.
| 13 | *Monocle Spyglass*: Sees objects far away as if they were up close, but disorients you.
| 14 | *Rapid-Reload Crossbow*: Never requires pausing to reload, but sometimes misfires.
| 15 | *Candlehelm*: Lights the way in front of you, but drips wax onto your face.
| 16 | *Rope Launcher*: Sends a rope flying a great distance, but requires time to wind it up.
| 21 | *Snorkel*: Lets you breathe underwater, but is easily spotted.
| 22 | *Spring-loaded hidden dagger*: Puts a dagger instantly into your hand, but can randomly activate.
| 23 | *Concoction Launcher*: Shoots a concoction a great distance, but is really cumbersome to carry.
| 24 | *Bear Trap*: Latches onto the foot of whoever steps in it, but is really dangerous to pick back up.
| 25 | *Corner Mirror*: Lets you see around corners, but is easily broken.
| 26 | *High* Pitch Whistle: Can only be heard by dogs and similar beasts, but gives you a headache.
| 31 | *Parachute*: Slows your fall, but you still hit the ground pretty hard.
| 32 | *Shockstick*: Stuns the one you hit with it, but also stuns you.
| 33 | *Portable Trampoline*: Lets you jump higher than you otherwise could, but is hard to put away.
| 34 | *Welding Torch*: Welds metal together with a hot flame, but showers you in sparks.
| 35 | *Escape Balloon*: Can pull you up into the air, but is almost impossible to control.
| 36 | *Spring Boots*: Let you make one giant leap, but take a long time to reload after use.
| 41 | *Glider*: Lets you control your descent, but it's absolutely terrifying.
| 42 | *Mining Drill*: Bores through stone very quickly, but gives -1d on calamity rolls when used in the dungeon.
| 43 | *Sticky Gloves*: Let you climb up a wall, but you can only reliably move up.
| 44 | *Two-Wheeler*: Lets you rapidly move over flat terrain, but the brakes don't work.
| 45 | *Electromagnet*: Strongly attracts metal, but shocks the hell out of you when you turn it off.
| 46 | *Retract-o-Claw*: Clamps onto whatever it's shot at, but retracts very slowly.
| 51 | *Rocket Pack*: Allows you to soar through the sky at rapid speeds, but can go off at any time.
| 52 | *Night-Vision Goggles*: Lets you see in the dark, but blinds you if you look directly at a light source.
| 53 | *Chainsaw*: Can tear through wood and flesh like butter, but merely wielding it is highly dangerous.
| 54 | *Rocket Boots*: Let you briefly move incredibly fast, but always launch you out of them at the end.
| 55 | *Flamethrower*: Fires jets of white hot fire, but the fuel tank is very vulnerable and fuel is limited.
| 56 | *Waterbreather*: Lets you breathe underwater, but your vision is highly limited.
| 61 | *Auto-Lockpick*: Allows you to roll the item's tier against any lock, but is very noisy.
| 62 | *Backpack Catapult*: Can launch fairly large stones, but takes up an extra gear or supply slot.
| 63 | *Clockwork Servant*: Can do one specific task that it's programmed to do, but rusts easily.
| 64 | *Laser Eye*: Fires a laser out of one of your eyes, but you have ***BRAINS*** shock while it recharges.
| 65 | *Robotic Limb*: Replaces a hacked off limb, but seems to have a mind of its own.
| 66 | *Boomstick*: Blows something within short range to smithereens, but also hits nearby allies.

## Laws of Spell Magic

Spell magic is a chase after power, pushing you down dark paths in pursuit of something far greater than could ever be achieved on your own. You might be grabbing the power for yourself or surrendering yourself to a more dominant, greater being in hope of gaining just a small portion of their eternal power in return. Monsters can cast spell magic from three different magic **disciplines**, each with its 
own **magic paths**:
- **Sorcery** draws power from strange, arcane forces. Its paths are *enchantment*, *evocation*, *force mastery*, *illusion*, *necromancy*, and *pyromancy*.
- **Witchcraft** draws power from spirits and nature. Its paths are *bloodreading*, *soothsaying*, *spiritcalling*, *stormstrike*, and *wildheart*.
- **Channeling** draws power from the worship of evil deities. Its paths are determined by the domains of the deity you serve.

As long as you have a **magic focus**, any Wicked One can ***Invoke*** magic. However, you can only cast tier 1 spells without the appropriate calling core ability.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Magic Focus**: Items like crystal balls, strange powders, crooked wands, spirit masks, or ancient tomes scrawled in blood that you use to wield magic. Each magic focus can only cast spells of a single magic path. They're usually related in some way to their path, though the exact choice of item is up to you. They can be *mundane items*, but must be clearly indicated as your focus on your character sheet.

When you ***Invoke*** magic, you cast spells to create magical effects that fall within the scope of the magical path you have chosen. The magical path acts as a limitation on what you can accomplish. When you ***Invoke*** a spell, you:
- **Accomplish something with magic that could have been accomplished with another action.** This allows you to use magic in place of other actions.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You summon vines and tendrils to tear the lock apart (replacing ***Finesse***, ***Tinker***, or ***Smash***). 
  > - You enchant the goblin and force him to give you the information you desire (replacing ***Trick***, ***Banter***, or ***Threaten***). 
  > - You meld with the shadows and reappear elsewhere (replacing ***Skulk*** or ***Trick***).

- **Accomplish something normally impossible without magic.** This allows you to get really creative with the things you do with magic.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You turn the guard dog into a pile of snakes.
  > - You summon a fire elemental to do your bidding.
  > - You rip memories out of the dead body’s mind.

### Spell Tiers

A spell is rated according to the results you're looking to achieve by casting it, ranging from tier 0 to tier 3. The higher the spell tier, the more strenuous, difficult, and dangerous to cast it becomes. Tier 2 and tier 3 spells can only be cast by a ***Shaman***, ***Warlock***, or ***Zealot***. They're more dangerous and difficult than normal spells, so tier 2 spells take -1d on the roll and tier 3 take -2d. They also cost stress to cast.

[context]: # (important rule)
> #### Invoking Spells (Process)
> 1. **The player describes the spell**, making sure to detail what they hope to accomplish with it.
> 2. **The GM sets the spell tier**, comparing what the player wants to accomplish to what can be accomplished by a normal action roll.
> 3. **The player rolls or reconsiders**, either accepting the GM’s judgement, looking for a way to modify the spell, or choosing another approach.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Ulna**: I'm going to use pyromancy here to engulf that house in flames.
>
> **GM**: Sounds like tier 2 to me. The house is kinda big. It’d probably take several actions or everyone working together normally.
>
> **Ulna**: Yeah, I don’t really have the stress to spend though. Hmm, can I get a smaller fire started now at tier 1 that can grow over time?
>
> **GM**: Yeah, that could be done with a single action roll. Tier 1 it is.

The GM determines what tier a spell is by comparing the intended result with what can be accomplished with a normal action. At its simplest, the system works as such:
- **Tier 0** spells achieve results much weaker than normal actions.
- **Tier 1** spells achieve results equivalent to normal actions.
- **Tier 2** spells achieve results greater than normal actions.
- **Tier 3** spells achieve results much greater than normal actions.

**Tier 1 spells set the baseline from which to judge the other tiers.** When the effect is one that can be accomplished with a different action, it's clearly tier 1. When the result isn’t normally possible without magic, the GM must make a judgement call and set its tier according to its relative impact. An impossible magical effect that feels about as impactful as a normal action is a tier 1 spell.

**The GM must also set the limit of what a tier 3 spell can accomplish.** They’re meant to be able to produce effects that can dominate a scene, accomplishing things that might take a team of workers some time to finish. Beyond tier 3 spells are **<ins>rituals</ins>** which cover the most powerful magical effects.

#### Tier 0 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Minor, Mostly Cosmetic Effects

**These spells achieve results that anyone could easily accomplish or are completely stylistic in nature.** Their main purpose is to blend magic into the narration, allowing you to couple them with other actions or flavor basic actions in a way to make your character feel more magical. They almost never require a roll.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You snap your fingers and light a candle. 
> - You call the wind to make your cape blow behind you. 
> - You send a shiver down someone’s spine, causing them to turn around.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

**These spells achieve results that could be accomplished with another action.** Their main purpose is allowing you to use ***Invoke*** in place of another action as long as you can creatively justify it within your magic path. They generally require a roll, unless there is no challenge or risk.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You ensorcel the horse’s mind, making it buck off its rider. 
> - You beseech Shabaz for power and hurl a lightning bolt at the knight in plate mail. 
> - You hear the blood coursing through the veins of the hidden rogue.

#### Tier 2 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Spend Stress to Cast; Take -1d on the Roll

**These spells achieve results that could only be accomplished with several actions or a team working together.** Their main purpose is to allow you to scale up spells to perform incredible feats, equivalent to other callings’ core abilities. They're inherently dangerous and always require a roll. You must spend stress to cast them and you take -1d on the roll.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You grow vines, snaking their way across the gap to form a bridge. 
> - You listen as your goddess, Melawa, tells you where the adventurers are hiding in ambush. 
> - You enchant the dryad, causing her to think someone else burned 
down her forest.

#### Tier 3 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Spend Stress to Cast; Take -2d on the Roll

**These spells achieve results that even a team working together would take quite some time to accomplish.** Their main purpose is to allow you to take center stage in a scene, but at great risk. They can also be used to accomplish things completely impossible with other actions. They're inherently dangerous and always require a roll. You must spend stress to cast them and you take -2d on the roll.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You hit the town wall with a huge amount of force, blowing a hole in it. 
> - You enter the spirit realm and possess the caravan guard. 
> - You conjure an illusion of a huge wyvern flying overhead, which 
chases away the cavalry pursuing you.

### Adjusting Spell Tiers

A tier 1 spell is usually an instantaneous or short-lived effect that affects a single target within a limited area. You can increase spell tiers by modifying these factors:
- You expand the **area** from a small area to a medium area, or a medium area to a large area. What constitutes the size of these areas is up to the GM.
- You expand the **duration** from a short time to a medium time, or a medium time to a long time. Permanent magical effects are only possible with rituals.
- You expand the **scale** allowing you to go from being in a tight spot to even footing, or from even footing to having the upper hand. This might also change the spell from a single target to a few targets, or a few targets to many targets.

### Limitations

Magic is powerful and flexible, but each magic path has some **limitations**. The first limitation is due to the nature of the magic and something you must deal with. You then choose a second limitation on your own, which serves to balance magic against normal actions. If your magic path is very broad and easy to apply to any situation, the limitation should scale that back some. If your magic path is already narrow, a minor fun limitation is more appropriate. When you choose a magic path, you should jot down a few ideas on your character sheet about what types of limitations you might have and discuss them with the GM.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - Wildheart requires you to interact with the natural environment.
> - Pyromancy is only effective against things that are flammable.
> - Labisha, the Flesh Eater, demands sacrifices to channel her magic.

### Summoning

Many magic paths may allow you to summon a <ins>pack of minions</ins> to do your bidding, usually lasting until the end of the current scene. If you summon a minion pack with a tier 0 or tier 1 spell, you're essentially rolling ***Invoke*** to accomplish something but describing it as a short-lived minion being summoned and performing the action for you. You use your ***Invoke*** action roll to determine the results. When you cast a tier 2 or 3 spell, you can summon a normal minion that will last for a scene. You determine what actions and impulses they have when you summon them.
- A tier 2 spell provides you with **a minion pack with no upgrades**.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You make the bones rise as a few skeletons to serve you.
  > - You summon a couple of minor demons to harass your enemies.
  > - You call some mangy coyotes to ravage the horses.

- A tier 3 spell provides you with **a minion pack with an upgrade or a 3d action**.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You raise a zombie horde that shambles into the town. 
  > - You pull a greater demon from the depths of hell, forcing it to serve.
  > - You howl into the night and a wolf pack answers your call.

### Other Rules

***Invoke*** has a few more uses that need clarification. Merely detecting, understanding, and even dispelling magic does not require a magic focus.

**Detect Magic**: You look for signs of magic. You don’t necessarily need to use ***Invoke*** to understand when there is magic, though, as you can usually ***Scan*** for it as well.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> You peer at the runes, suddenly realizing it's a stasis spell.

**Dispel Magic**: When you dispel a magical effect, you must cast a spell of a tier equal  to the strength of the magic in effect. This is determined by the GM.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> You sprinkle crushed pixie wings on the chest and the trap's magic fades.

**Resistance**: You can use ***Invoke*** to make a resistance roll. When you do, describe the spell and how it resists the consequence. The GM then sets the tier of the spell, usually tier 1. Remember that to use an action to resist, it can’t have <ins>weak</ins> effect. Spells work the same way. If a tier 1 spell would have <ins>weak</ins> effect, it might take a tier 2 or even a tier 3 spell. A tier 2 or tier 3 spell used to resist still costs stress and you take a penalty to the roll as usual. This allows you to resist things in a much larger capacity than otherwise possible.

> You cast a tier 3 force mastery spell to stop the tower from collapsing.

**Conferring Action Ratings**: When a spell confers a new action rating on a PC, such as transmuting their body or boosting them with magic, the action rating is equal to the tier of the spell cast.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> You use wildheart to take on the aspects of a bear. Your ***Smash*** is 3d.

**Conferring Abilities**: Spells can mimic calling abilities, even core abilities. This requires a tier 3 spell to do so.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> You cast a tier 3 pyromancy spell, turning into a flaming elemental. This gives you the Warlock's ***Vile Form*** ability.

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Magic Requires Good Communication
> Much like position and effect, the GM is in the best place to consistently judge magical effects within the fiction. GMs should try to be transparent and open to questions about why you’ve judged the effects in certain ways. This will help inform your players’ decisions as they get used to the power level of magic. Players should be forgiving if the GM judges two identical spells as different tiers since judging something so incredibly flexible can be tough. We’re all human, right?

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "Okay Xog, you’re hiding in the cart now and heading into town."
>
> **Xog**: "I wanna get that charm necklace I saw the merchant ride into town with. I need that to finish my ritual. So as the cart pulls into the town square, I’m going to need a distraction."
>
> **GM**: "What do you have in mind?"
>
> **Xog**: "I’m going to use my bloodreading magic here. I want to make this merchant suddenly throw up violently to buy me an opening."
>
> **GM**: "Yeah, that sounds like a tier 1 spell to me, kind of like a ***Trick***. You could push it and make the 3 or 4 people standing around the merchant’s stall all throw up. That’d be tier 2."
>
> **Xog**: "Actually, I think I want to go big here instead. Let’s make everyone in this square suddenly start retching. Then hopefully I can snatch the charm and make my escape."
>
> **GM**: "Awesome, that’s a tier 3 spell, so you take -2d on your action roll here. If you fail, your spell’s probably going to backfire on you in this busy town square."

[context]: # (example of play)
> **GM**: "You're watching the nomads bring their herd through the valley. A few have their bows out, scanning the treelines and expecting trouble. Rorgar, you said you were leading the way. What do you do?"
>
> **Mezz**: "Hold up! I just had an idea. I want to flashback to last night and call on Vahoona to fill the nomads' dreams with nightmares of Rorgar here feasting on their flesh."
>
> **GM**: "Okay, what are you trying to accomplish with that?"
>
> **Mezz**: "I want 'em to break and scatter as soon as they even see Rorgar."
>
> **GM**: "Yeah, that's like a large scale ***Threaten***, plus doing it from afar through their dreams. I think this is going to need a tier 3 spell."
>
> **Torin**: "Could you throw a rolling fog into those dreams, with Rorgar charging out of it?"
>
> **Mezz**: "Sure, what are you thinking?"
>
> **Torin**: "What if we team up here? You ***Invoke*** the dreams in the flashback and I'll ***Invoke*** a rolling fog with stormstrike in the present."
>
> **GM**: "Oh, that's good! It's a bit weird having the team up rolls happening at two separate times, but it feels right for what you're trying to accomplish. Let's roll with it. The fog is a tier 2 spell, affecting a lot of people with it. You could do something similar with a team of people lighting fires and creating smoke. Alright, let's see some rolls."

### Potions

Potions are bottled elixirs with potent magical effects. They're usually in liquid form, though it’s not unheard of to find these magical essences within a dust or some other form. They're consumed upon use. The tier of a potion is equal to the tier of spell it would take to create the effect normally. Potions are brewed by spending a downtime action. You make two doses with a single downtime action and it is always a tier 1 project, regardless of the tier of the potion. On a mixed, the potion becomes volatile. Example potions, with volatilities listed after "but..." are on the next page. The effects and volatility of potions are determined by the player and GM when crafting them. You must have the proper core ability to brew tier 2 or tier 3 potions.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Brewing more potent potions carries more risk, just like casting spells. You take -1d on the roll when brewing tier 2 potions and -2d when brewing tier 3 potions. You don't spend stress as you would when casting higher tier spells, though.

**You must state an ingredient or two when brewing a potion.** The stress you would normally spend to cast a spell is replaced within a potion by ingredients. Ingredients tend to be related to the effect of the potion in some way, such as a cat eye for a potion that allows you to see in the dark. It's assumed that you can collect most ingredients you need when brewing and you can weave this collecting of them into your downtime action narration. Here are some example ingredients:


#### Potion Ingredients

[randomizable]: # (potion ingredients)
| | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| bat wings | fool's gold | rabbit foot |
| beetle guts | frog spit | rose thorns |
| bent ring | four-leaf clover | rusty key |
| broken mirror | owl feather | scorpion tail |
| crushed pine cone | poison ivy | seashells |
| curdled goat milk | pumpkin seeds | snake teeth |

**Especially rare ingredients give you +1d to the roll to brew a potion.** These ingredients are almost always procured within a scene under risky conditions. They might be things like unicorn blood, fairy dust, mermaid scales, prince tears, or a lion's tail. You might...
- Use unicorn blood to make a *potion of healing*.
- Use fairy dust to make a *potion of flying*.
- Use mermaid scales to make a *potion of waterbreath*.
- Use prince tears to make a *potion of disguise*.
- Use a lion's tail to make a *potion of courage*.

## Laws of Ritual Magic

Rituals push magic to its limits, allowing you to bring forth truly horrifying magical effects, transcending what is possible with spell magic. You do not need to have spellcasting ability or even ***Invoke*** to incant a ritual, though without some magical ability, you do need a proper explanation for why you know the ritual.

Rituals are incanted with downtime actions, using any action that makes sense within the fiction. You must also meet a number of special requirements equal to the ritual's tier before the ritual can be completed. The GM and player work together to choose interesting requirements. Special requirements are something challenging to accomplish, usually requiring a scene or perhaps even a raid to do so.

**A ritual's tier is determined by how large of an impact it will have on the story.** Cursing a farmer is usually easier than cursing a noble, though if that farmer is an important figure in the story, setting the curse on them becomes much more difficult. The GM sets the tier as follows:

### Tier 1 Rituals
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Minor Impact; Fulfill 1 Requirement

**These rituals achieve results that have a minor impact on the story.** They tend to be useful for PCs, but have minor effect on NPCs.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You permanently raise some skeletons to serve you as a minion pack. 
> - You build a teleportation circle between two places you've been.
> - You make all milk in a town to go rancid, causing paranoia.

### Tier 2 Rituals
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Moderate Impact; Fulfill 2 Requirements

**These rituals achieve results that have a moderate impact on the story.** They tend to give PCs a strong advantage or push NPCs into a tough spot.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You plant fear in the baron’s mind, causing him to betray the duke. 
> - You link the fate of two people together, so if one dies, they both die. 
> - You conjure a large wall of ice, blocking the mountain path.

### Tier 3 Rituals
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Major Impact; Fulfill 3 Requirements

**These rituals achieve results that have a major impact on the story.** They tend to drastically alter the entire dynamic of the story and NPCs must deal with the fallout.

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - You call forth a mighty storm, earthquake, or other natural disaster. 
> - You summon a nightmarish creature beyond your control to wreak havoc on a local region. 
> - You cause a blight, destroying and cursing farmland for miles around.

[context]: # (important rule)
> Rituals often bring attention from outside forces seeking to stop it. The GM can make a blowback roll just before it's completed to see if anyone intervenes.

### Ritual Requirements

- **Blood Magic**: You must feed the ritual with your own blood, leaving you bloodied. *What does the scar look like?*
- **Fasting**: You're not allowed to eat while preparing this ritual. You take shock to an attribute each time you incant this ritual. *Why must you go through such suffering?*
- **Intimate Materials**: You need an item that the target of the ritual greatly values or cares about deeply. *Why is it so important to them?*
- **Place of Power**: You must perform the ritual at a specific place of power, such as deep within a volcano or a long forgotten battlefield. *How does the place magnify the ritual's power?*
- **Rare Ingredients**: You must collect rare ingredients before you can cast the spell - often from high, inaccessible mountain peaks or at the bottom of deep, dark lakes. *What stands between you and the ingredient?*
- **Ritual Cleansing**: Your body must be thoroughly cleansed with ointment, blood, or other special materials. *What are you being cleansed of?*
- **Sacrifice**: You must sacrifice some type of animal or even a specific person. *What's special about the required sacrifice?*
- **Secret Knowledge**: You require secret, arcane information from a specific source. *What do you have to give up to acquire this knowledge?*
- **Special Focus**: You require a special item or creature that the ritual’s power is channeled through. If the item or creature is destroyed, the magic effect is also destroyed. *How is the magic channeled through this focus?*
- **Timing**: You can only perform the ritual at a specific time, such as a certain lunar phase or when the stars align. When your ritual starts, the GM starts an additional 4, 6, or 8 segment clock and ticks it each lurking phase to represent the time approaching. *What is significant about the timing?*
- **Trial**: You must undergo some trial to prove yourself worthy before the ritual can be completed, such as swimming across a dangerous river, burning down a temple, or finding and killing a wyvern without using any weapons. *What makes the task more dangerous than is immediately apparent?*

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Grem**: "Okay, so it's a tier 3 ritual to turn the river into a river of blood. What kind of special requirements work for this?"
>
> **GM**: "Blood magic fits perfectly and maybe performing it at a place of power. How about this? Let's say that there's a waterfall upriver, so you'll need to perform it there, shedding your own blood into the river."
>
> **Grem**: "Those work. Also, sacrifice makes sense. Maybe I have to throw a person off the top of the waterfall, too. How about the town's butcher?"

### Magic Items

Given their line of work, dungeon monsters are bound to come across magic items, whether they're hanging off the bodies of dead adventurers, hidden away in a wizard’s closet, or being secretly transported in a grain caravan. Magic items often give permission to do something that you couldn't otherwise do, rather than enhance your abilities. Like anything else in the fiction, they may count as circumstance bonuses towards position and effect. 

**Magic items can be crafted with a ritual of a tier equal to the item being enchanted.** The tier of the magic item is set in the same way as a ritual, based on its impact within the story. You must also fulfill ritual requirements, though one of these is always a special focus to be enchanted.

As these items have quite a broad range of power, you can balance their power by giving them a drawback. The drawback is decided prior to crafting it. Remember that a tier 1 magic item already becomes *volatile* when you get a mixed on the roll, making it possible to be *volatile* twice.

- **Activation**: You must activate it in some way, such as by taking stress or paying cost. After activation, it might only be usable once or for a short time.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You turn over the hourglass, giving yourself one hour of protection.
  > - You take stress to launch a fireball from the wand.
  > - You put a gold coin in the tiny statue's mouth and it tells you a secret.
- **Limited use**: It only has a certain number of uses before it becomes completely unusable or needs to be recharged in some way.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - You must throw one of the seeds to grow a tree at that spot.
  > - The flaming sword has a chance of burning out, needing to be dipped in lava to regain its power.
  > - Every time you use the eaglewing cape, a few more feathers fall off.
- **Volatile**: It's *volatile*, having some negative effect on the user when used.

  [context]: # (list of examples)
  > - The cinderstone burns you every time you use it.
  > - The jumping boots make you queasy every time you use them.
  > - The lightning wand arcs to an ally after it hits your enemies.

[context]: # (example of play)
> **Martok**: "I wanna make a staff that can shoot fireballs."
>
> **GM**: "Hmm, seems like tier 2. Let's say the special requirements are a staff that's survived being dipped in lava and a tiny captured flame elemental. It kinda needs a drawback to balance it out, though."
>
> **Martok**: "I don't want it to cost stress, so what if I can only use it once before I need to dip it into lava to recharge the elemental inside it?"
>
> **GM**: "That's cool, and since you have a lava flow within the dungeon, it effectively becomes recharged at recovery."

## Sorcery

You reach out and seize control of primal, arcane energies, twisting them to serve your own nefarious purposes. Sorcery is the purview of Warlocks, who can learn to cast higher tier spells within this magic discipline. Those who wield sorcery draw their power from a variety of sources. Some tap into the underlying energies that created the world. Others harness the remnants of life energy remaining in corpses. This power might even come from within, such as a forbidden mystical heritage or a heart corrupted by dark experiences.

Over the following pages, the sorcery magic paths are laid out with example spell failures, limitations, magic focuses, and spells. Remember that spell tiers fluctuate depending not on the spell effect itself, but on what you're trying to accomplish with it. All of these are merely examples to help show what might be possible within that path. Magic is a creative endeavor and up to you to define the power you wield.

**Sorcery has the following magic paths:**

- **Enchantment**: Manipulate Weak Minds
- **Evocation**: Summon Hellish Fiends
- **Force Mastery**: Move Objects at Will
- **Illusion**: Confuse the Senses
- **Necromancy**: The Cold Caress of Unlife
- **Pyromancy**: Watch the World Burn

[context]: # (tips)
> #### Make Your Own Spells, Don't Just Use The Examples
> All of the spells over the next several pages are merely examples of what you might do within that magic path, to help you get a better sense of what the path covers and how spell tiers work. Magic in *Wicked Ones* is free-form and you should be taking advantage of that to craft useful spells on the fly! When you first make a character, it's a really good practice to brainstorm a couple of spells at each tier and talk it over with the GM to see if you're on the same page about the magic path and spell level. You can also grab some of the example spells and write them in, too!

### Enchantment: Manipulate Weak Minds

You delve deep into the minds of others, eliciting emotion and controlling thoughts. You can alter memories, implant the seeds of action, or give explicit commands which you expect to be followed. The weaker the mind, the stronger your magic is.

When enchantment spells fail, you might falsely believe it worked, the target may become aware of what you were attempting, or the spell might be reflected back at you.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Enchantment only works against living creatures and tends to work better on those with lesser intelligence. You might also have to share a language or only be able to elicit a certain range of thoughts and emotions.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Interrogate***: Their eyes cloud and they blurt out where the gold is.
> - ***Recognition***: They think they met you before, grinning as you approach.
> - ***Emotion Control***: Anger replaces annoyance as the guard draws his sword and threatens his friend.

#### Tier 2 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to a Team's Action or One Person Over Time

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Implant Urge***: The merchant stops the caravan and hops off to take a leak.
> - ***Hypnotism***: They fall into a deep hypnotic state, ready for your suggestion. The first thing they'll do when they get back to the fort is fire the captain.
> - ***Memory Loss***: With a wave of the hand, the guard forgets you were ever there.

#### Tier 3 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to a Team Over Time or Impossible Effects

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Dominate***: The farmers heft pitchforks and defend you with their lives.
> - ***Implant Memory***: The troll suddenly remembers you saved his life in the river and offers to help you take down the town wall.
> - ***Betray Oath***: The knight plunges the sword into his lord's back.

### Evocation : Summon Hellish Fiends

The hells are full of demons, devils, and fiends waiting to be pulled forth from their firey domain and put to good use. You open portals and pull through whatever servants you need, binding them to do your bidding.

When evocation spells fail, the fiend you summoned might take vengeance on you for disturbing them, break free and run amok, or hold a grudge against you.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Evocation requires the actual summoning and binding of creatures from hell, which generally don't take too kindly to this. You might also leave lingering portals or need to make small offerings to appease them.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Thief***: A tiny whiptail demon appears and picks the lock for you.
> - ***Annoyance***: Quasits appear and grab the bag from the merchant.
> - ***Whip***: A demonic whip appears in your hand and you lash the sorcerer with it

#### Tier 2 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to a Team's Action or One Person Over Time

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Hellish Workcrew***: A pack of wretches appear and rip down the wall.
> - ***Warrior***: A barbed demon climbs out of a pit and tackles the knight.
> - ***Winged Servant***: A winged demon flies high into the sky to look for the caravan.

#### Tier 3 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to a Team Over Time or Impossible Effects

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Hellhounds***: A pack of hellhounds run down the fleeing horsemen.
> - ***Pits of Hell***: Flaming pits erupt along the ground dragging some villagers into them, then lava begins pouring out into the village.
> - ***Devilish Transformation***: Your form twists into that of a devil, with flaming sword and spiked armor.

### Force Mastery : Move Objects at Will

There is a force flowing throughout this world, intertwining all objects. You can sense and manipulate this tension to propel non-living matter as you please. Living matter, on the other hand, defies this force and is beyond your ability.

When force mastery spells fail, you might drop whatever you were moving on an ally, break it apart instead of picking it up, or move it way beyond where you intended.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Force mastery can only move objects, not things that are alive such as plants and animals. You might also only be able to move one type of material, like stone, or lose one of your senses while casting.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Snatch***: The sword flies from the soldier's hands and into yours.
> - ***Slide***: The bolt slides allowing the door to swing open.

#### Tier 2 Spells

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Build***: Stones pulled from the cliff form a stairway to climb up it.
> - ***Slam***: The house's support beam breaks and the whole structure comes down.
> - ***Protect***: Pots and pans form a protective wall in front of you.

#### Tier 3 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to a Team Over Time or Impossible Effects

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Heavy Lifting***: The small sailing ship lifts out of the water.
> - ***Flying Disc***: You stand on a small disc, then lift it into the air and fly away.
> - ***Symphony***: Every door and shutter in the town slam open and shut over and over, terrifying the townsfolk and causing pandemonium.

### Illusion : Confuse the Senses

Not all is as it seems, a fact you know better than anyone. The eyes can be tricked quite easily, though the nose and ears may be a little tougher. As one begins to lose trust in their senses, they may even begin to question their own reality.

When illusion spells fail, they might depict the wrong scene, briefly manifest into reality, or confuse you into believing they're working even though they're not.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Illusion requires that you've previously seen or experienced what you're conjuring. You might also only be able to affect one sense or be unable to control who is affected by your spells.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Minor Image***: The sailor's clothes catch on "fire," so they jump into the harbor.
> - ***Simple Scene***: The "guard" paces back and forth on the walls, hiding the fact that the real guard is dead.
> - ***Imaginary Foe***: A "huge ogre" steps out of the cave and charges your enemies.

#### Tier 2 Spells

### Necromancy : The Cold Caress of Unlife

Flesh and bone have memory of life and, even once the spark is gone, that memory can be forced to serve your will. You can fill these vessels with necrotic energy to bring forth unlife or turn that necrotic energy against living flesh, sapping its strength.

When necromancy spells fail, the ghosts of those you're raising might hinder you, a skeleton may break free of your command, or the memories of your victims could haunt you.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Necromancy requires flesh or bone and tends to work far better on the already dead. You might also need to lay your hands on the target or place your own soul within a vessel.

### Pyromancy : Watch the World Burn

Fire is the ultimate destructive force. It's wild, fickle, and blazing hot. But within that chaos, there is a beauty that captivates your attention. It's a cleansing force that those who wield can unleash upon the world.

When pyromancy spells fail, you might light up your allies instead, catch something unintended on fire, or burn up a piece of your own gear.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Pyromancy requires what you're targeting to be burnable and struggles against anything resistant to fire. You might also be unable to cast in rain or need to directly shoot flames from a body part like your mouth.

## Witchcraft

You call upon or compel natural and ancestral spirits to assist you with your evildoings. Witchcraft is the purview of Shamans, who can learn to cast higher level spells within this magic discipline. Wielders of witchcraft draw their power from nature or the spirit world. You might have been raised by wolves and taught their secrets, possessed by a spirit who now is your companion, or been hit by lightning, which released your ability to command it.

Over the following pages, the witchcraft magic paths are laid out with example spells, failures, limitations, and magical focuses. Remember that spell tiers fluctuate depending not on the spell effect itself, but on what you're trying to accomplish with it. All of these are merely examples to help show what might be possible within that path. Magic is a creative endeavor and up to you to define the power you wield.

**Witchcraft has the following magic paths:**

- **Bloodreading**: The Pulse of Life
- **Soothsaying**: The Timeless Eye
- **Stormstrike**: The Storm's Fury
- **Spiritcalling**: The World Beyond
- **Wildheart**: The Brutality of Nature

### Bloodreading : The Pulse of Life

Bodies are nothing more than the blood coursing through their veins, and you know blood well. You can sense it, read it, control it, and use it to push people past their limits, seal wounds closed, or force its body to do terrible things.

When bloodreading spells fail, you might invigorate your target, send them into a blood-boiling rage, or harm yourself instead.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Bloodreading requires a living target. You might also need to make them bleed first or touch their flesh with your own before you can cast spells on them.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Tears of Blood***: The victim sheds tears of blood, horrifying themself and those around them.
> - ***Heartbeats***: You listen intently and hear the hiding priest's heartbeat from the choir balcony above you.
> - ***Spasm***: The sailor inexplicably throws the crate into the water.

> - ***Close Wounds***: The Zealot loses the bloodied condition and ***MUSCLES*** shock.
> - ***Bloodbond***: Any wounds taken by the Marauder are taken by you instead.

### Soothsaying : The Timeless Eye

You can cast your sight far and wide, moving your senses forwards and backwards through time. You play with alternative versions of the future and delve into events in the past, looking to unlock valuable secrets.

When soothsaying spells fail, you might get bad information, curse yourself by toying with future timelines, or make the one who you were viewing aware of your presence.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Soothsaying only sees a possible version of the future and a likely version of the past, being prone to error and misinterpretation. You might also only be able to see through a certain element or require a related item.


#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)

[context]: # (list of examples)
> - ***Cast Senses***: Your sight floats through a small crack in the wall and into the other side, showing you the butcher ready with a cleaver held high.

> - ***Traces***: Time rewinds around you, rushing through major events in the area.
> - ***Shared Sight***: You view the world through the guard's eyes as they go on patrol.

### Spiritcalling : The World Beyond

The spirits of the dead linger, waiting to take care of unfinished business. They have their own motivations, but when you talk, they listen. They're a good source of information, but only know what they've seen.

When spiritcalling spells fail, you might attract unwanted attention from dangerous spirits, scare friendly spirits away, or slip into the spirit realm yourself.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Spiritcalling requires there to be the lingering spirits of the dead, and the more recent the better. You might also only be able to see animal spirits or have to broker deals with them for their help.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

> - ***Possess***: You slip into the spirit realm and possess your victim.
> - ***Spirit Travel***: You leave your mortal husk behind and guide your spirit to investigate the border fort.

### Stormstrike : The Storm's Fury

The storm is the ultimate power of nature, wreaking havoc and destruction without reserve. You understand the ebbs and flows of the storm, harnessing it for your own purposes. You control clouds, wind, rain, hail, and lightning.

When stormstrike spells fail, you might cause favorable weather conditions for your enemies, strike your allies, or lose control of the raging storm.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Stormstrike requires access to the open sky or flowing winds. You might also have your magic affected by the current weather conditions or need to recharge yourself occasionally by being struck by lightning.

> - ***Thunderstorm***: Torrential rain pelts the town, keeping everyone inside.
> - ***Tornado***: An uncontrollable funnel cloud descends into the fields, throwing livestock and fieldhands into the air.

### Wildheart : The Brutality of Nature

The power of nature is immense, but you hold sway over it. The dark beasts and creepy crawlers of the world obey your commands. Gnarled roots and thorny vines move when you beckon. Even the cold soil and rushing waters answer your calls.

When wildheart spells fail, you might lose nature's trust for a while, slip into a temporary feral state, or nature might cause unintended trouble.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Limitations**: Wildheart requires plants, animals, or aspects of nature to interact with. You might also only able to cast while on solid ground or limit yourself to one style such as casting plant magic with seeds.

#### Tier 1 Spells
[context]: # (summarizing subtitle)
> Equal to Other Actions in Impact

## Channeling

You call upon a dark god, demigod, or powerful fiend that, in return for your worship, allows you to wield a small fraction of their power. Channeling is the purview of Zealots, who can learn to cast higher level spells within this magic discipline.

You can choose one of the following evil gods to follow or make up your own. Each god has a title followed by two domains, which combine to form your magic path. The descriptions of the gods are intentionally vague. They're meant more as creative prompts than lore of the world, giving hooks that you can use to define your character's religion. When you decide to worship a god, take some time and discuss it with the GM but don't worry about detailing everything. You'll flesh it out over time through play. Choose one of the follow dark deities or make up your own:

- **The Imperial Family: The Follies of Civilization**
  - **Gorlag**, The Blessed Emperor, God of *Conquest* and *Tyranny*
  - **Iziza**, The Sweet Mistress, Goddess of *Seduction* and *Trickery*
  - **Melkahar**, The Rotting Prince, God of *Pestilence* and *Decay*
  - **Gimosha**, The Flame of Jealousy, Goddess of *Greed* and *Envy*
  - **Dalgeth**, The Grumbling Malcontent, Goddess of *Cunning* and *Treachery*
  - **Nezame**, The Joyful Hedonist, God of *Pleasure* and *Satisfaction*
  - **Melawa**, The Keeper of Secrets, Goddess of *Knowledge* and *Deceit*
- **The Wild: The Essence of Nature**
  - **Shabaz**, The Unscrupulous Destroyer, God of *Tempests* and *Blights*
  - **Labisha**, The Flesh Eater, Goddess of *Slaughter* and *Savagery*
  - **Talazar**, The Relentless Stalker, God of *Vengeance* and the *Hunt*
  - **Crevis**, The Quivering Wretch, God of *Cowardice* and *Suffering*
  - **Vahoona**, The Howler at Night, Goddess of *Nightmares* and *Twilight*
  - **Zaheen**, The Dancing Madman, God of *Luck* and *Chaos*

Channeling does not have the same limitations as sorcery and witchcraft. Instead, you must strive to please your god, else they will **forsake** you. Minor infractions may be overlooked, but when you have displeased them enough, the punishment is quite severe.

[context]: # (important rule)
> **Forsaken**: When forsaken, you lose access to tier 2 and tier 3 spells until you have atoned in some way. The GM can also compel you towards actions that would please your god, essentially the opposite of the things that you can be forsaken for. If you suppress the compel, your god immediately forsakes you.

### Gorlag, The Blessed Emperor

**God of Conquest and Tyranny**. As the head of the imperial family, he rules with an iron fist, ever-intent on expanding his domain and tightening control.

Gorlag may forsake you if you displease him, such as by running like a coward from battle, giving up an opportunity to seize power, or taking orders from your lessers.

**Goddess of Seduction and Trickery**. She is all sweet words and lies. She wormed her way into Gorlag's good graces, got her tentacles around him, and never let go.

## Under the Full Moon

This is what the PCs have been working towards. The ritual of lycanthropy will curse the merchant's son and unleash the terror of a werewolf on the region. All that's left is to bargain with a dire wolf and perform the ritual under the light of the full moon.

[context]: # (example of play)
>
> **GM**: Crag, this is kind of your deal. Go ahead and set the scene for us here.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Cool, so we're in a small glade, deep in the northern woods, illuminated by the full moon. We've dragged the prisoner out here and draped the wolf pelt over them. I look at the moon and howl as loud as I can. I want to ***Banter*** here, I guess. I'm calling a dire wolf.
>
> **GM**: Let's just make that the engagement roll. Your ***Banter*** is 1d, right?
>
> **The GM rolls 1d engagement and gets a mixed!**
>
> **GM**: Well, you certainly got its attention. You hear a howl in return pierce the night. It's answering your call. You all look at each other, thinking this might go well. Then, you hear another howl, and another, and a few more. They're all around you. It might not be as easy as you thought.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I motion for the others to just relax and say, "Let 'em come." We wait a few tense moments until the wolves appear at the tree line.
>
> **GM**: You just barely spot a wolf at the glade's edge, waiting. Then you spot another. From behind you, you hear a low, deep growl. You turn to see the dire wolf inching out of the forest towards you. It's noticed the wolf pelt and is moving towards the prisoner, sniffing the air.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: I'm going to Invoke wildheart here and speak directly to the dire wolf.
>
> **GM**: It could be tier 1 if all you're trying to do is convey a basic concept like "friend" or "run." But negotiating with a wolf isn't something you could normally even do, so anything complex is tier 3. I think we can wrap the attempt to convince them into the Invoke roll as well. Also, I'm gonna roll the blowback for this ritual real fast to see if anyone's noticed what you're all up to. I think I'll keep the roll secret for now.
>
> **The GM rolls 2d blowback and gets a failure!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Yeah, this is going to be tier 3. I'll take the -2d on the roll, but I'm putting a dark heart into it. I'll tell you what I say after the roll.
>
> **GM**: Okay, gotcha. It's dire. This is an ancient forest spirit and you're all surrounded. On a failure, I think the wolves attack you for trespassing. On a mixed, the dire wolf accepts your friendship, but eats the human. As an aside, Slem, what's your ***Scan***?
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: Ummm, it's 3d now. I put my dot from reckless xp into it last session. Hey, can Crag get a dark bargain here? Maybe I'm transfixed on the dire wolf and whatever you need to know my ***Scan*** for is instead a 2d roll?
>
> **GM**: Sounds fair to me. Crag?
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Yeah, I'll take that. Here's my roll.
>
> **Crag rolls 3d ***Invoke*** (3d - 2d + 1d +1d) and gets a success!**
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: Yes! Alright, I stand in front of the prisoner, between it and the wolf, and begin uttering in wolf-speech. It's mostly barks and growls. "Great one, we brought a gift, a gesture of friendship. Or if it pleases you, I have a better idea. Help us give it the lycan curse to wreak havoc on the human villagers and in return, we'll guarantee the northern woods remain yours." 
>
> **GM**: The dire wolf's on board. You can complete the ritual. But just a sec...
>
> **The GM rolls 2d engagement (Slem's ***Scan*** - 1d) and gets a critical!**
>
> **GM**: Looks like help is gonna show up a bit too late! The critical means you'll be able to finish the ritual before they arrive. Slem, you look up from the dire wolf to see riders on giant eagles highlighted against the moon.
>
> **Slem [Slissik Shadow]**: I exchange glances with Ulrot, gesture with my head at the adventurers incoming, then put a finger to my mouth, telling him to wait.
>
> **Crag [Kobold Shaman]**: The dire wolf lunges forward, snarling maw directly over the kneeling prisoner. Saliva drips down, covering his head. I howl to the moon and the wolves join me, completing the ritual. The wolf pelt embeds itself into the man's back, a painful process. Then the howling stops and the wolves leave. The prisoner is shaking as I cut the cords holding him. He looks down at his hands, already beginning to turn, then bolts for the trees. I say, "Let him go. This'll all be just a bad dream when he wakes."
>
> **Ulrot [Orc Brute]**: "Good deal. Now that that's all finished up," I pull my axe, "we've got some adventurers to kill." I ***Rage*** and chuck my axe at an eagle.
